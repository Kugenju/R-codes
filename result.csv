A comparison of the sequence of the dengue-2 16681 virus with that of the candidate vaccine strain (16681-PDK53) derived from it identified 53 of the 10,723 nucleotides which differed between the strains. Nucleotide changes occurred in genes coding for all virion and nonvirion proteins, and in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Twenty-seven of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid alterations. The greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prM (2.20%; 2/91 amino acids) followed by the M protein (1.33%; 1/75 amino acids), the C protein (0.88%; 1/114 amino acid), and the E protein (0.61%; 3/495 amino acids). Differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 1.51% (6/398 amino acids) in NS4 to 0.33% (3/900 amino acids) in NS5. The encoded protein sequences of 16681-PDK53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighbor-joining tree method. The analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence, and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group. Comparisons of the sequences of the flavivirus polymerase and helicase-like proteins (NS5 and NS3, respectively) with those from other viruses yielded a classification of the flaviviruses indicating that the primary division of the flaviviruses was between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks.",1992

The env and gag genes from feline leukaemia virus were expressed in a thymidine kinase-negative feline herpes-virus and a baculovirus. Cats were vaccinated with various combinations of these recombinant viruses and 100% protection against feline leukaemia virus challenge was achieved using an immunization schedule which utilized both env and gag products delivered at both a mucosal and systemic site.",1992
"3","s11867","relocation of antigens to the cell surface membrane can enhance immune stimulation and protection.","relocation of antigens to the cell surface membrane can enhance immune stimulation and protection.. The major outer capsid glycoprotein of rotaviruses, VP7, is normally synthesized and directed to the ER, where it is required for virus assembly. By substituting a foreign signal sequence for the VP7 signal peptide, a secreted form of VP7 with an authentic amino terminus was produced. Secreted VP7 was further modified by the addition of a transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic domain to its C-terminus. When the novel chimeric protein was expressed in transfected cells it became anchored in the cell surface membrane. The antigenicity of the chimeric protein was compared with that of the intracellular form of VP7 using recombinant vaccinia viruses to deliver the antigens in vivo. The novel antigen produced enhanced stimulation of both B and T lymphocytes of the immune system, and in mice it was able to induce protection against rotavirus-induced diarrhoeal disease. Other secreted and intracellular antigens show a similar improved level of antigenicity as a result of their relocation to the cell surface. Surface localization may therefore have general utility in the development of recombinant subunit vaccines.",1992

A sensitive and specific blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to distinguish infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV)-infected animals from those immunized with a glycoprotein gIII deletion mutant, IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. For this ELISA, undiluted test sera are used to block the binding of an anti-IBRV gIII monoclonal antibody (mAbgIII)-horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugate to gIII antigen. TMB substrate is used for color development. Negative S/N values (defined as the absorbance at 650 nm of test sera/absorbance at 650 nm of negative control sera) of > 0.80 were obtained with immune sera from gnotobiotic cattle immunized with several bovine viruses, with bovine antisera to bovine herpesvirus-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus, with porcine antisera to pseudorabies virus and parvovirus, and with normal sera from heterologous species. Negative S/N values were also obtained with sera from rabbits twice vaccinated with IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. However, the S/N values became positive (S/N < 0.8) 10 to 17 days after the rabbits were challenge exposed to virulent IBRV(Cooper). Most of 116 sera (84%) from feedlot cattle with virus neutralization (VN) titers of < 1:2 or < 1:4 had negative S/N values > 0.8, but 18 sera with negative VN titers had positive S/N values, consistent with observations indicating that an IBRV outbreak was occurring in one of the feedlot herds. Thirty nine sera (98%) from feedlot cattle with VN titers of 1:2 to 1:128 had positive S/N values (< 0.8). One serum with a VN titer of 1:2 had a borderline (+/-) S/N value of 0.81. After immunization with a commercial gIII-positive IBRV vaccine, 115/116 sera with VN titers of 1:2 to 1:256 had positive S/N values (< 0.8). One serum with a VN titer of 1:2 had a negative S/N value of 0.83. Serum from one vaccinated animal that failed to seroconvert after vaccination (VN < 1:4) showed a strongly positive ELISA S/N of 0.48.",1992

Canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) are over 98% similar in DNA sequence but have specific host range, antigenic, and hemagglutination (HA) properties which were located within the capsid protein gene. In vitro mutagenesis and recombination were used to prepare 16 different recombinant genomic clones, and viruses derived from those clones were analyzed for their in vitro host range, antigenic, and HA properties. The region of CPV from 59 to 91 map units determined the ability to replicate in canine cells. A complex series of interactions was observed among the individual sequence differences between 59 and 73 map units. The canine host range required that VP2 amino acids (aa) 93 and 323 both be the CPV sequence, and those two CPV sequences introduced alone into FPV greatly increased viral replication in canine cells. Changing any one of aa 93, 103, or 323 of CPV to the FPV sequence either greatly decreased replication in canine cells or resulted in an inviable plasmid. The Asn-Lys difference of aa 93 alone was responsible for the CPV-specific epitope recognized by monoclonal antibodies. An FPV-specific epitope was affected by aa 323. Amino acids 323 and 375 together determined the pH dependence of HA. Amino acids involved in the various specific properties were all around the threefold spikes of the viral particle.",1992
"6","s12601","identification and functional analysis of the fowlpox virus homolog of the vaccinia virus p37k major envelope antigen gene.","identification and functional analysis of the fowlpox virus homolog of the vaccinia virus p37k major envelope antigen gene.. A fowlpox virus (FPV) gene with homology to the vaccinia virus p37K major envelope antigen gene was identified and sequenced. The predicted product has a molecular weight of 43,018 Da (p43K). The FPV p43K gene has 37.5% identity with its vaccinia counterpart and higher homology with a molluscum contagiosum virus gene (42.6% identity). Based on upstream sequences, p43K appears to be regulated as a late gene. Recombinant FPV were generated in which a large portion of p43K was replaced by the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. These recombinants failed to produce visible plaques under standard conditions. After prolonged incubation the microplaques developed into small macroscopic plaques. Plaques were purified on the basis of lacZ expression. Single-cycle growth curves comparing the p43K-deleted recombinant (designated fJd43Z) with parental FPV showed that the two viruses produce identical amounts of intracellular virions, but that fJd43Z released 20-fold fewer infectious particles into the medium. CsCl gradient centrifugation of [3H]thymidine-labeled virus was employed to examine differences in the production of physical particles. The two viruses produced equivalent levels of intracellular virions, but fJd43Z failed to produce detectable levels of released particles. FPV p43K is therefore involved in the release of virions from infected cells.",1992

We have produced the human class II histocompatibility protein, HLA-DR1, as a soluble, secreted glycoprotein in insect cells infected with baculoviruses carrying truncated alpha and beta subunit genes. The peptide-binding site is empty, and the empty molecules are fully competent to bind antigenic peptide. We used the empty molecules to measure an intrinsic rate for peptide association, and to investigate the role of peptide in stabilizing the class II structure. Peptide binding kinetics for the empty molecule are only 10-fold faster than for peptide exchange into an occupied site, suggesting that a conformational change may accompany peptide binding. The native alpha beta heterodimer assembles in the absence of antigenic peptide, but peptide binding stabilizes the empty heterodimer against aggregation and against SDS-induced denaturation.",1992

Serotyping of group A rotaviruses obtained from stools of 158 diarrheic patients in Chiang Mai, Thailand, by ELISA with monoclonal antibodies revealed a yearly change in the prevalence of individual serotypes. Three unusual human rotavirus strains were isolated. Strain Mc35 had subgroup I-serotype 10 antigen and a long RNA electrophoretic type, a property hitherto found only in bovine rotaviruses. RNA-RNA hybridization tests showed that the strain is more closely related genetically to bovine than to human rotaviruses. Strain Mc323, although serologically closely related to serotype 9, had subgroup I specificity and a long RNA electrophoretic type, a characteristic common to nonhuman rotaviruses. Strain Mc345, with an aberrant RNA pattern possibly due to genome rearrangement, had the same antigenic specificity as Mc323. These 2 strains were genetically very closely related to each other and were more related to porcine than to human rotaviruses. These results provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of human rotaviruses.",1992
"9","s16621","antigenic and genetic characterization of the haemagglutinins of recent cocirculating strains of influenza b virus.","antigenic and genetic characterization of the haemagglutinins of recent cocirculating strains of influenza b virus.. The antigenic and genetic characteristics of the haemagglutinins of influenza type B viruses isolated since 1988 during periods of both widespread activity (1990/1991) and sporadic activity (1989/1990) were examined using microneutralization tests and direct RNA sequencing. During 1989/1990, influenza B viruses representative of two distinct lineages antigenically and genetically related to either B/Victoria/2/87 or B/Yamagata/16/88 were isolated, and a minor drift variant of B/Yamagata/16/88, B/Hong Kong/22/89, was identified. In 1990/1991, B/Hong Kong/22/89- or B/Yamagata/16/88-like viruses accounted for the majority of the influenza virus isolates in most countries. Sequence analysis of the HA1 domains of representative viruses confirmed the continued existence of two main lineages among recent strains of influenza B virus and identified unique amino acid changes that could account for the altered antigenic reactivity of some variants. Sequence analysis of the HA2 domains of some of the recent influenza B viruses allowed for a comparison of the evolutionary rates and patterns between the HA1 and HA2 domains.",1992

Antigens in a particulate conformation were shown to be highly immunogenic in mammals. For this reason, the particle forming capacity of derivatives of the HIV-1 group specific core antigen p55 gag was assayed and compared dependent on various expression systems: recombinant bacteria, vaccinia- and baculoviruses were established encoding the entire core protein p55 either in its authentic sequence or lacking the myristylation consensus signal. Moreover, p55 gag was expressed in combination with the protease (p55-PR) or with the entire polymerase (p55-pol), respectively. Budding of 100-160 nm p55 core particles, resembling immature HIV-virions, was observed in the eucaryotic expression systems only. In comparison to the vaccinia virus driven expression of p55 in mammalian cells, considerably higher yields of particulate core antigen were obtained by infection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with the recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis (AcMNPV) baculovirus. Mutation of the NH2-terminal myristylation signal sequence prevented budding of the immature core particles. Expression of the HIV p55-PR gene construct by recombinant baculovirus resulted in complete processing of the p55 gag precursor molecule in this system. The introduction of an artificial frameshift near the natural frameshift site resulted in constitutive expression of the viral protease and complete processing of p55, both in Escherichia coli and in vaccinia virus infected cells. Interestingly, significant processing of p55 resembling that of HIV infected H9 cells could also be achieved in the vaccinia system by fusing the entire pol gene to the gag gene. Moreover, processing was not found to be dependent on amino-terminal myristylation of the gag procursor molecule, which is in contrast to observations with type C and type D retrovirus. However, complete processing of p55 into p24, p17, p9 and p6 abolished particle formation. Purified immature HIV-virus like particles were highly immunogenic in rabbits, leading to a strong humoral immune response after immunization. Empty immature p55 gag particles represent a noninfectious and attractive candidate for a basic vaccine component.",1992

When a new strain of an influenza virus is required to be incorporated into influenza vaccine, attempts are made to recombine such strains with laboratory adapted viruses, which will grow to high titre in order to improve the yield of the vaccine strain. It is important that such high growth reassortant vaccine strains are not contaminated with genes coding for the antigenic determinants of the high growth laboratory strain. We describe the characterization of two recent high growth reassortants and the application of the polymerase chain reaction to ensure their genetic identity and purity.",1992

We tested the ability of macaques vaccinated with inactivated whole simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to resist challenge with either homologous or heterologous cell-free uncloned SIV administered by the intravenous route. The vaccine virus was derived from a proviral DNA clone and thus was considered genetically homogeneous. Sixteen macaques received either hepatitis B surface antigen (n = 6) or the inactivated whole-SIV vaccine (n = 10) at weeks 0, 4, and 49 of the study. All SIV vaccine recipients developed high levels of homologous and heterologous neutralizing antibodies in response to vaccination. At the time of challenge (week 53), vaccinees were further stratified to receive either homologous (n = 10) or heterologous (n = 6) uncloned live SIV. The envelope glycoproteins of the homologous and heterologous challenge viruses were 94% and 81% identical to the vaccine virus, respectively. Regardless of challenge inoculum, all vaccinees in the control group (hepatitis B surface antigen) became infected, whereas all SIV vaccinees were protected against detectable infection. These data support the concept that an efficacious vaccine for HIV might be possible, and suggest that genetic variation of HIV might not be an insurmountable obstacle for vaccine development.",1992
"13","s24640","developments in foot-and-mouth disease vaccines.","developments in foot-and-mouth disease vaccines.. The current status of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine production is reviewed. The production of antigen in bovine tongue epithelium (Frenkel culture) is described and improvements in monolayer and suspension cultures of cell lines are outlined. Inactivation of viral antigen and safety tests are discussed. A 'minimum safety level' is recommended: at the end of the inactivation process, antigen batches of any size should contain less than one virus particle. After inactivation the antigen can be formulated into a vaccine or purified and concentrated for storage at ultra-low temperatures in a vaccine bank. Vaccines prepared with the adjuvants Al(OH)3 and saponin are compared with (double) oil emulsion vaccines. Because oil vaccines can protect both cattle and pigs and induce long-term protection, they are most suitable for use in ring vaccinations. A new generation of vaccines, based on constructed modified-live viruses or (bio-) synthetic peptides, is briefly reviewed.",1991

We report here genetic recombination between 2 USDA-licensed vaccine strains of pseudorabies virus co-inoculated into swine. The vaccine strains, one of which was a conventionally attenuated strain and the other, a genetically engineered deleted strain containing a negative immunologic marker, had complementary genomes. Co-inoculation resulted in the creation of novel strains of pseudorabies virus containing negative immunologic markers with restored virulence genes. Plaque-purified recombinant progeny viruses were found in 2 litters of pigs in which both strains were co-inoculated IM, a litter in which both strains were co-inoculated oronasally, and a litter in which the conventionally attenuated strain was inoculated oronasally and the genetically engineered strain was inoculated IM. Recombinant phenotypes and recombinant restriction fragment patterns were observed. The creation, spread, and potential misdiagnosis of these types of recombinant strains could disrupt control and eradication programs that are based on the serologic identification of swine infected with potentially virulent strains of pseudorabies virus.",1991
"15","s25700","molecular and antigenic analyses of serotypes 8 and 10 of bovine rotaviruses in thailand.","molecular and antigenic analyses of serotypes 8 and 10 of bovine rotaviruses in thailand.. Antigenic and genomic properties of non-serotype 6 bovine rotaviruses isolated in Thailand and Japan were studied by cross-neutralization tests, nucleotide sequence determination of the VP7 gene, and RNA-RNA hybridization. Two Thai strains (61A and A44) were serologically related to a Japanese isolate KK3 which has been assigned to serotype 10. In contrast, strain A5 was found to be antigenically similar to human strain 69M with serotype 8 specificity, although strain A5 showed a one-way cross-reaction with serotype 6 strain NCDV. VP7 sequence analysis confirmed these results. High degrees of similarity in nucleotide and amino acid sequences (92.5 to 98.2% and 96.3 to 97.9%, respectively) were found among the VP7 genes of the four serotype 10 bovine strains (61A, A44, KK3 and B223). The VP7 amino acid sequence of strain A5 was similar to those of serotype 8 human strains (91.7% and 94.8% for strains B37 and 69M, respectively). In RNA-RNA hybridization experiments, a high level of overall relatedness was found among the three serotype 10 bovine strains (61A, A44 and KK3), and strains A5 and NCDV were also moderately related to the three serotype 10 viruses. All the bovine rotaviruses tested in this study, regardless of their serotype specificity, exhibited a moderate genetic-relatedness to strain 69M of serotype 8, and, to a lesser extent, to serotype 2 human rotavirus strains.",1991

The gene encoding glycoprotein 14 (gp14) of equine herpesvirus type 1 was sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a complete transcription unit composed of a CAT box, a TATA box, a ribosome-binding sequence, a polyadenylation signal and an open reading frame (ORF) of 2940 bp transcribed from left to right. The amino acid (aa) sequence deduced from this ORF corresponded to that of a protein with 979 aa and had the characteristic features of membrane gp including a 20-aa signal sequence at the N terminus, a 743-aa surface domain, a 40-aa membrane anchoring region, a 108-aa hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain at the C terminus and eleven potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. An unusual feature of this protein was an exceptionally long (66aa) sequence, with a preponderance of hydrophilic residues, preceding the hydrophobic signal core. An antigenic determinant recognized by an anti-gp14 monoclonal antibody was present in the N terminus of the postulated surface domain. Comparison of gp 14 with the gp of other herpesviruses indicated that gp14 was highly homologous to corresponding gp of pseudorabies (gII), bovine herpesvirus (gI), varicella-zoster virus (gII), as well as of herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus (gB).",1990

The neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza B viruses B/Maryland/59, B/Hong Kong/8/73, B/Singapore/222/79, B/Oregon/5/80, B/USSR/100/83, B/Victoria/3/85, B/Leningrad/179/86, B/Memphis/6/86, and B/Memphis/3/89 have been sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences show high variability in the stalk domain of the NA, but a surprising degree of sequence conservation in the head region which carries all the antigenic and enzyme activity. The variable region coding for the neuraminidase stalk also translates into a variable section in the overlapping NB polypeptide, which is coded from a second reading frame that overlaps the first 100 amino acids of NA. The influenza B NAs are antigenically distinguishable with monoclonal antibodies in neuraminidase-inhibition tests, even when there is only one amino acid sequence difference. However, seven of nine escape mutants selected with monoclonal antibodies were distinguished only by the antibody used for selection. When NA heads of influenza B viruses are crystallized, there are remarkable differences in crystal morphology between neuraminidases which have very few sequence changes.",1990
"18","s27413","antigenic relationships among human rotaviruses as determined by outer capsid protein vp4.","antigenic relationships among human rotaviruses as determined by outer capsid protein vp4.. cDNA clones representing the VP4 gene of symptomatic human rotavirus strain KU (VP7 serotype 1) or DS-1 (VP7 serotype 2) or asymptomatic human rotavirus strain 1076 (VP7 serotype 2) were constructed and inserted into a baculovirus expression vector under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. The resulting recombinants expressed the appropriate authentic VP4 rotavirus outer capsid protein. Guinea pigs immunized with these VP4 proteins developed antibodies that neutralized infectivity of the rotavirus from which the immunizing VP4 was derived. These antisera were then used in neutralization tests to define the extent and distribution of VP4 antigenic polymorphism among human rotaviruses. Three distinct serotypes and one subtype of the VP4 outer capsid protein were identified among 17 human rotavirus strains that had previously been assigned to five distinct VP7 serotypes. For the most part, VP4 serotype segregated independently of VP7 serotype. Ten strains of human rotavirus that were associated with symptomatic infection and that exhibited VP7 serotype 1, 3, 4, or 9 specificity, each possessed a VP4 of the same serotype and subtype, designated VP4 serotype 1A. Both symptomatic human rotavirus strains with VP7 serotype 2 specificity were related by neutralization to the VP4 serotype 1A strains and were classified as a subtype of VP4 serotype 1--i.e., serotype 1B--since viruses of serotype 1A appeared to be prime strains. Four human rotavirus strains that were recovered from healthy infants in newborn nurseries in which virus transmission persisted over a long interval, belonged to VP7 serotype 1, 2, 3, or 4, but each strain possessed the same VP4 antigenic specificity that was designated VP4 serotype 2. Finally, a single strain of symptomatic human rotavirus of VP7 serotype 1 specificity possessed a unique VP4 that was provisionally classified as VP4 serotype 3 but this remains to be confirmed because neutralization tests were performed in only one direction. Among the 10 rotavirus strains whose VP4 gene was previously sequenced, there was complete concordance between assignment of VP4 serotype by neutralization and classification according to VP4 amino acid homology. Thus, rotaviruses that exhibited a VP4 amino acid homology of 89% or greater belonged to the same VP4 serotype and subtype as determined by neutralization. Finally, evidence was obtained that the serotype-specific domain is located on the VP8 subunit of VP4.",1990

We generated a number of simian virus 40 (SV40) mutants with single amino acid substitutions in T antigen between residues 388 and 411. All but one mutant (398LV) replicated like wild-type SV40 and gave rise to normal-size plaques. Three different mutations at residue 402 (Asp to Glu, Asn, or His) totally prevented the formation of stable complexes with the cellular protein p53 in monkey cells but had no effect on virus replication. Only one other mutation in this region, involving residue 401 (Met to Thr), slightly inhibited the formation of T-monkey p53 complexes. The three mutant T antigens with substitutions at residue 402 also formed no stable complexes with human p53 but generated low levels of complexes with mouse p53. These results indicate that residue 402 is critical for binding to monkey and human p53 proteins and is important for binding to mouse p53. We suggest that it is one of several points of contact. In cells infected with any one of the three residue 402 mutant viruses. T antigen and p53 became increasingly phosphorylated, as they were in cells infected with wild-type virus. Our data therefore show that stable T-p53 complexes are not required for replication of SV40 in culture or for enhanced phosphorylation of either protein.",1991

Intratypic recombinants of P2/Sabin and P2/117, a neurovirulent vaccine revertant, have been generated in vitro using infectious cDNA clones and used to demonstrate that strong determinants of the attenuation and temperature-sensitive phenotypes of P2/Sabin reside in the 5' 492 nucleotides. In this region of the genome the viruses differ only at nucleotides 437 and 481. The ts phenotype associated with the 5' noncoding region is expressed at different temperatures in different cell lines, suggesting an involvement of cellular factors which may be species specific. Suppression of both the ts and attenuation phenotypes correlates with an A-G mutation at nucleotide 481, although other changes are also involved.",1991

The complete nucleotide sequence of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV-1) was determined from a cDNA clone of mRNA. The mRNA is 1683 nucleotides long (excluding polyadenylic acid) and encodes a protein of 524 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 57,548. An amino acid identity of 83% was predicted between the NPs of the human pathogen hPIV-1 and the murine paramyxovirus, Sendai virus, compared to 72% similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequence. In contrast, the amino acid sequence identity between the NPs of hPIV-1 and hPIV-3 was 59%, suggesting a more distant evolutionary relationship. The NP amino acid sequences of hPIV-1 and Sendai virus were highly conserved in the amino-terminal half of the molecule, in which 395 of the first 420 amino acids were identical. Of 11 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeted against the Sendai virus NP, five cross-reacted with the hPIV-1 NP. The MAbs that cross-reacted recognize epitopes within regions of high amino acid similarity between the NPs of the two viruses. Also, five of the eight MAbs raised against hPIV-1 NP cross-reacted with Sendai virus NP. Taken together, our observations suggest that the essential amino acid sequence determinants of the NP structures of hPIV-1 and Sendai virus are conserved despite changes in their nucleotide sequences during evolution. This implies that there was a selective pressure to maintain the important functional domains of the protein.",1991

Evidence indicates that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may be important in containing the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the infected host. Although the use of recombinant viruses has been proposed as an approach to elicit protective immunity against HIV, the ability of recombinant viral constructs to elicit CD8+ CTL responses in higher primates has never been demonstrated. A live recombinant virus, vaccinia-simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac), was used to determine whether such a genetically restricted, T lymphocyte-mediated antiviral response could be generated in a primate. Vaccinia-SIVmac vaccination elicited an SIVmac Gag-specific, CD8+ CTL response in rhesus monkeys. These CTLs recognized a peptide fragment that spans residues 171 to 195 of the Gag protein. The rhesus monkey major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene product restricting this CTL response was defined. Both the vaccinated and SIVmac-infected monkeys that shared this MHC class I gene product developed CTLs with the same Gag epitope specificity. These findings support the use of recombinant virus vaccines for the prevention of HIV infections in humans.",1991

Two weeks later, all of the monkeys were challenged by intravenous inoculation of P. falciparum (Indochina strain) parasites. A group of unimmunized monkeys was challenged in parallel. All of the monkeys that received vaccinia virus recombinants or the control virus produced good anti-vaccinia virus antibody responses. However, those that received a single construct containing ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) given at eight sites did not produce significant antibody to any of the three major RESA repeat epitopes after immunization but were primed for an enhanced antibody response after challenge infection with P. falciparum. Most of the monkeys produced detectable antibodies to the RESA epitopes after challenge infection. One group of monkeys was immunized with four constructs (expressing RESA, two merozoite surface antigens [MSA-1 and MSA-2], and a rhoptry protein [AMA-1]), each given at two sites. While these monkeys failed to produce significant antibody against MSA-2 or AMA-1 after immunization, they produced enhanced responses against these antigens after challenge infection. Immunization involved an allelic form of MSA-2 different from that present in the parasite challenge strain, so that the enhanced responses seen after challenge infection indicated the presence of T-cell epitopes common to both allelic forms. No groups of monkeys showed any evidence of protection against challenge, as determined by examination of the resulting parasitemias.",1991

B19 parvovirus is pathogenic in humans, causing fifth disease, transient aplastic crisis, some cases of hydrops fetalis, and acquired pure red cell aplasia. Efforts to develop serologic assays and vaccine development have been hampered by the virus's extreme tropism for human bone marrow and the absence of a convenient culture system. We constructed recombinants containing either the major (VP2) or minor (VP1) structural proteins of B19 in a baculovirus-based plasmid, from which the polyhedrin gene had been deleted; these recombinant plasmids were used to generate recombinant infectious baculovirus. Subsequent infection of insect cells in vitro resulted in high-level expression of either B19VP1 or VP2. Parvovirus capsids were obtained by self-assembly in cell cultures coinfected with either VP1- and VP2-containing baculoviruses or, surprisingly, VP2-containing baculoviruses alone. Empty B19 capsids composed of VP1 and VP2 could replace serum virus as a source of antigen in a conventional immunoassay for detection of either IgG or IgM antiparvovirus antibodies in human serum. Immunization of rabbits with capsids composed of VP1 and VP2 resulted in production of antisera that recognized serum parvovirus on immunoblot and neutralized parvovirus infectivity for human erythroid progenitor cells. Baculovirus-derived parvovirus antigen can substitute for scarce viral antigen in immunoassays and should be suitable as a human vaccine.",1991

Modified-live, attenuated infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) hybrid virus vaccines have been constructed by inserting in the major IBRV glycoprotein gIII gene chemically synthesized deoxyribonucleotide sequences encoding the bovine growth hormone signal sequence and monomeric or dimeric forms of the foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP 1 epitope sequences. The foreign DNA sequences were inserted at the N-terminal end of the IBRV gIII coding sequence and were driven by the IBRV gIII promoter. The sequences encoding the first 38 and the first 21 amino acids of the IBRV gIII were deleted from the hybrid viruses containing inserts of the monomeric and dimeric FMDV epitope sequences, respectively, to avoid redundant signal sequences. Plaque immunoassay experiments with guinea pig and bovine anti-FMDV peptide antisera, and with anti-IBRV gIII monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that IBRV-FMDV fusion proteins were expressed in virus-infected MDBK cells. Immunoelectron microscopy analyses demonstrated that the IBRV-FMDV fusion proteins were expressed as repeated structures on the surface of virus particles. Experiments showed that the recombinant IBRV-FMDV viruses protected cattle from IBRV (Cooper) challenge and induced anti-FMDV peptide antibodies, thereby demonstrating that the FMDV epitopes were expressed in vivo.",1991

Adenovirus type 7 vaccine strain was engineered to express foreign antigens from both the E3 early promoter in the E3 region and the major late promoter inserted between the E4 region and the right inverted terminal repeat. This multiple expression vector was used to express hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The gene inserted in the E3 region was derived from the core gene of the hepatitis B virus genome. When the precore region was present, an immunoreactive group of proteins with molecular weights ranging from 15,000 to 19,000 was secreted into the media. Velocity sedimentation centrifugation of media and lysates from cells infected with recombinants containing the core gene with the precore region resulted in peaks of HBeAg at the top of the gradient where authentic HBeAg should be found. In addition to the core gene in the E3 region, the surface antigen gene of hepatitis B virus was inserted behind the major late promoter in the E4 region resulting in an adeno-hepatitis recombinant virus capable of expressing both the core gene and the HBsAg cells. Cells infected with the adeno-hepatitis recombinants could also be stained with peroxidase-conjugates after reacting to antibody against HBcAg. Inoculation of dogs with the recombinant viruses which contained the core gene, with and without the precore sequence, resulted in a significant antibody response to HBcAg/HBeAg. The dogs also produced a significant antibody response to HBsAg as well as neutralizing antibody to adenovirus.",1991

The poliovirus P2/P712 strain is an attenuated virus that is closely related to the type 2 Sabin vaccine strain. By using a mouse model for poliomyelitis, sequences responsible for attenuation of the P2/P712 strain were previously mapped to the 5' noncoding region of the genome and a central region encoding VP1, 2Apro, 2B, and part of 2C. To identify specific determinants that attenuate the P2/P712 strain, recombinants between this virus and the mouse-adapted P2/Lansing were constructed and their neurovirulence in mice was determined. By using this approach, the attenuation determinant in the central region was mapped to capsid protein VP1. Candidate attenuating sequences in VP1 and the 5' noncoding region were identified by comparing the P2/P712 sequence with that of vaccine-associated isolate P2/P117, and the P2/117 sequences were introduced into the P2/Lansing-P2/P712 recombinants by site-directed mutagenesis. Results of neurovirulence assays in mice indicate that an A at nucleotide 481 in the 5' noncoding region and isoleucine (Ile) at position 143 of capsid protein VP1 are the major determinants of attenuation of P2/P712. These determinants also attenuated neurovirulence in transgenic mice expressing human poliovirus receptors, a new model for poliomyelitis in which virulent viruses are not host restricted. These results demonstrate that A-481 and Ile-143 are general determinants of attenuation.",1991

A unique requirement for live attenuated reassortant influenza vaccines is the need to generate new reassortant vaccine viruses with the appearance of each new antigenic variant. Thus, the attenuation phenotype conferred by the attenuated donor influenza virus must remain genetically stable during the generation of each new reassortant vaccine virus. In this study we used nucleotide sequence analysis to evaluate the genetic stability of the attenuating M and NP genes of the avian influenza A/Mallard/NY/6750/78 attenuated donor virus during the in vitro generation and subsequent in vivo replication of avian-human (AH) influenza A reassortant vaccine viruses in monkeys and humans. Nucleotide sequence changes in the M and NP genes occurred at a rate of approximately 0.61 substitutions/1000 nt/reassortant during in vitro generation of four AH reassortant viruses. Only two nucleotide sequence changes occurred in the M and NP gene segments of four isolates of H1N1 or H3N2 AH vaccine viruses following 6-8 days of replication in seronegative children, and neither change affected amino acids previously identified as playing a potential role in attenuation. In addition, there were no changes in the nucleotide sequence of the M and NP genes of single gene AH reassortant viruses following five serial passages in squirrel monkeys. Finally, there was no change in the level or duration of replication of the single gene reassortant viruses in the upper or lower respiratory tract of monkeys following serial passage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1991

Recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the entire gag (p55) or CA (p24) region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were constructed by inserting the appropriate HIV DNA sequences into the E3 region of human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) with and without an exogenous SV40 early promoter. The infectious recombinant adenoviruses Adgag1, AdSVgag1, and AdSVCA1 were shown to express the appropriate HIV-1 antigens in human cells in vitro, as measured by immunoprecipitation and p24 antigen capture assays. Using the p24 antigen capture assay, HIV antigen expressed by AdSVCA1 was detected earlier in infection and in greater amounts than that produced by either Adgag1 or AdSVgag1. In studies concerning the immunogenicity of these vectors, Balb/c (H-2d) mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 10(7) or 10(8) plaque-forming units of purified vector developed serum antibodies to p24, detected by Western blotting, by 2 weeks postinjection. In the preliminary test of the immunogenicity of the recombinant adenovirus vectors in primates, two of four rhesus macaque monkeys generated antibodies to HIV-1 p24 following two injections of AdSVCA1. As expected, monkeys injected with control adenovirus failed to show any anti-HIV response, and none of the monkeys showed any adverse reactions following infection with either recombinant or control adenoviruses. These results suggest that adenovirus vectors have considerable potential in the study of possible immune therapies for HIV infection.",1991

We previously described the cloning and expression of the protective antigen (PA) gene of Bacillus anthracis in both vaccinia virus and a baculovirus. The antigenicity of the PA products was characterized. PA expressed by the recombinant vaccinia viruses elicited a partial protective immune response against a lethal B. anthracis spore challenge in guinea pigs and mice. The WR strain vaccinia virus recombinant (WR-PA) protected 60% of male mice and 50% of guinea pigs. WR-PA elicited high anti-PA antibody titers in mice but not in guinea pigs. Connaught strain vaccinia virus recombinants failed to protect any immunized animals. PA purified from baculovirus recombinant-infected cultures plus adjuvant partially protected male CBA/J mice and completely protected female Hartley guinea pigs from challenge. Both the recombinant and nonrecombinant PA preparations combined with adjuvant elicited high anti-PA antibody titers in Hartley guinea pigs and CBA/J mice. These data demonstrate that the recombinant baculovirus- and vaccinia virus-produced PAs were immunogenic in both guinea pigs and mice, that the baculovirus-PA recombinant was a useful source of immunogenic PA, and that vaccinia virus-PA recombinants may be feasible live anthrax vaccine candidates worthy of consideration for further development as live vaccines.",1991

Analysis of canine parvovirus (CPV) isolates with a panel of monoclonal antibodies showed that after 1986, most viruses isolated from dogs in many parts of the United States differed antigenically from the viruses isolated prior to that date. The new antigenic type (designated CPV type 2b) has largely replaced the previous antigenic type (CPV type 2a) among virus isolates from the United States. This represents the second occurrence of a new antigenic type of this DNA virus since its emergence in 1978, as the original CPV type (CPV type 2) had previously been replaced between 1979 and 1981 by the CPV type 2a strain. DNA sequence comparisons showed that CPV types 2b and 2a differed by as few as two nonsynonymous (amino acid-changing) nucleotide substitutions in the VP-1 and VP-2 capsid protein genes. One mutation, resulting in an Asn-Asp difference at residue 426 in the VP-2 sequence, was shown by comparison with a neutralization-escape mutant selected with a non-CPV type 2b-reactive monoclonal antibody to determine the antigenic change. The mutation selected by that monoclonal antibody, a His-Tyr difference in VP-2 amino acid 222, was immediately adjacent to residue 426 in the three-dimensional structure of the CPV capsid. The CPV type 2b isolates are phylogenetically closely related to the CPV type 2a isolates and are probably derived from a common ancestor. Phylogenetic analysis showed a progressive evolution away from the original CPV type. This pattern of viral evolution appears most similar to that seen in some influenza A viruses.",1991

The 50% human infectious dose (HID50) in infants and children was 10(2.9) and 10(2.6) TCID50 for the ah and ca vaccine, respectively. The ah influenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 reassortant was reactogenic: 24% of infants and children infected with greater than or equal to 100 HID50 had fever greater than or equal to 39.4 degrees C. Since H3N2 ah vaccines were previously shown to be adequately attenuated, it is reasonable to suggest that the genes that code for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the H1N1 virus apparently influence the reactogenicity of reassortant viruses derived from the avian influenza A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 donor virus. Because this avian virus does not reproducibly confer a satisfactory level of attenuation to each subtype of influenza A virus, it is not a suitable donor virus for attenuation of wild-type influenza viruses. In contrast, the ca A/Ann Arbor/6/60 donor virus reliably confers attenuation characteristics to a variety of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses.",1991

Virulence of ILT viruses was based on an intratracheal pathogenicity index, mortality, and tracheal lesions. Intratracheal pathogenicity indices for ML vaccine viruses ranged from 0.0 to 0.14, while those for field isolates were 0.20 to 0.82. Mortality was a consistent clinical feature of field isolates; all produced mortality, with seven of the 11 isolates causing two or more deaths per inoculation group. In contrast, only one of six ML vaccine viruses produced mortality (one death per inoculation group). In general, tracheal lesions were more severe in chickens inoculated with field isolates and were produced more consistently than in chickens inoculated with vaccine viruses. These studies indicate that virulence of ILT field isolates was greater than that of ML vaccine viruses. Together with previous restriction endonuclease analyses, these findings suggest the possibility that field isolates originated from ML vaccine viruses through reversion to parental-type virulence.",1990

The vaccine contained the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, and the gene for its non-structural proteins from wild-type (wt) B/Ann Arbor/1/86 virus, the contemporary strain at the time of the study. Other genes were derived from ca B/Leningrad/14/55 virus. No increase in illness rates was seen in the children from ages 3-15 years given vaccine at maximum potency (a one in two dilution of infectious allantoic fluid, having a titre of 10(7.0) EID50) compared to children given placebo. About 60% of seronegative children, ages 3-7 years, exhibited a detectible antibody response following one dose of intranasal vaccine, with the seroresponse rate rising to greater than 70% after two doses of vaccine. Immunogenicity was lowest in seropositive children age 8-15 years, reaching a maximum of 36% after two doses. Results indicated that the vaccine was highly attenuated, and probably of adequate immunogenicity for kindergarten age children. The lower immunogenicity in older children suggests the vaccine might be overly attenuated for use in school-age children who are more likely to have a history of prior natural infection with influenza B virus.

The gene encoding the specific antigen (S antigen) induced on the surface of vaccinia virus-infected cells was mapped on the viral genome by the construction of recombinant viruses. The S gene is located in the 1.5-kbp XbaI-AccII fragment between 11.1 and 12.6 kbp from the right end of the viral genome. Nucleotide sequencing of the fragment revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 351 codons capable of producing a polypeptide with a molecular weight (MW) of 40,701 Da. Mapping of the S mRNA by primer extension indicates the presence of the transcription initiation site that precedes the translation initiation codon by 14 nucleotides. The region preceding the S mRNA start site is extremely A/T-rich and has sequence similarity with other early genes. The signal for termination of transcription of the early genes, TTTTTAT, is included near the end of the ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a typical membrane signal characterized by a hydrophobic region in the N-terminus. An early polypeptide with a MW of 40 kDa, in agreement with the size predicted from the ORF, was synthesized by cell-free translation of the mRNA selected by hybridization to a plasmid containing the region of the ORF.",1990

Western blot analysis of lysates prepared from Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant viruses confirmed that the baculovirus-expressed NP antigens were reactive with monoclonal antibodies specific for either type A or B NP and with anti-NP antibodies in human serum samples. Electrophoretic analysis indicated that the expressed NP antigens comigrated with NP purified from influenza A or B virions and that the recombinant NP antigens represented greater than 10% of total protein in infected cells. Dilutions of clarified Sf9 cell lysates were used as antigens in a standard enzyme immunoassay to detect serum antibody specific for influenza A or B viruses. The results from assays using the baculovirus-expressed NP antigens showed good correlation with the results obtained using bacterially expressed NP antigen as well as complement fixation.

Vaccinia virus recombinants which have a broad host range can be useful vectors for both human and veterinary applications, while fowlpox virus recombinants, with a host range restricted to avian species, provide useful vectors for application to poultry diseases. Significantly, avipoxviruses have also been shown to be useful as vaccinating vectors in non-avian species. The results presented in this paper were selected to provide the reader with a sense of the extensive potential present in recombinant poxviruses as live recombinant vaccine candidates. The broad host range of vaccinia vectors and the narrower host range of avipoxvirus provide interesting applications. The surprising results obtained in non-avian species with recombinant fowlpox viruses are quite intriguing.

Recombinant vaccinia viruses that contained regions of the gag-pol open reading frames of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were constructed. Cells infected with recombinants containing both gag and protease genes expressed and processed HIV gag antigens efficiently. Processing was much reduced in cells infected with recombinants containing only gag, but not the protease gene. However, significant amounts of p41 were produced by protease-defective recombinants. This protein was immunoreactive with p24-specific monoclonal antibodies and was produced in a truncated form by a recombinant containing a 3' deletion in the p15 coding region of gag ORF. These results indicate that p41 could represent an alternative gag precursor with N-terminal sequences derived from p24 and C-terminal from p15. Ultrastructural analysis of recombinant-infected cells revealed that the gag antigens expressed were assembled into retrovirus-like particles and were secreted into culture medium. This assembly process was not dependent on HIV protease function, because immature core particles were produced by recombinants lacking HIV-1 protease functions. Immunization of mice and chimpanzees with vaccinia-HIVgag recombinant viruses generated both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to HIV gag antigens. These recombinants are therefore useful not only for studying HIV virion processing and assembly, but also for designing immunogens for the prophylaxis and immunotherapy against AIDS.",1990

To investigate the concept of producing live recombinant vaccines using these serotypes, adenovirus types 4 (Ad4) and 7 (Ad7) were constructed that produce HBsAg upon infection of cell cultures. Ad4 recombinants were constructed that express HBsAg from a cassette inserted 135 bp from the right-hand terminus of the viral genome. The cassette contained the Ad4 major late promoter followed by leader 1 of the tripartite leader, the first intervening sequence between leaders 1 and 2, leaders 2 and 3, the HBsAg gene, and tandem polyadenylation signals from the Ad4 E3B and hexon genes. Using this same cassette, a series of Ad4 recombinants expressing HBsAg were constructed with deletions in the intervening sequence between leaders 1 and 2 to evaluate the contribution of the downstream control elements more precisely. Inclusion of regions located between +82 and +148 as well as +148 and +232 resulted in increases in expression levels of HBsAg in A549-infected cells by 22-fold and 44-fold, respectively, over the levels attained by an adenovirus recombinant retaining only sequences from +1 to +82, showing the importance of these elements in the activation of the major late promoter during the course of a natural Ad4 viral infection. Parallel increases were also observed in steady-state levels of cytoplasmic HBsAg-specific mRNA. When similar Ad7 recombinant viruses were constructed, these viruses also expressed 20-fold more HBsAg due to the presence of the intron. All Ad4 and Ad7 recombinants produced HBsAg particles containing gp27 and p24 which were secreted in the medium. When dogs were immunized intratracheally with one of these Ad7 recombinants, they seroconverted to both Ad7 and HBsAg to a high level.",1990

The advent of recombinant DNA techniques and advances in immunology have provided a means for dissecting the immunobiology of disease-causing agents. Identification and expression of individual genes from the pathogens in heterologous systems, such as VV, have yielded valuable information regarding structural properties of the gene products and their role in eliciting protective immunity. Targets of both humoral and/or cellular immunity for many disease-causing agents have been identified or confirmed using a VV expression system (Section IV). Additionally, specific VV recombinants have induced a protective immune response in experimental animals. The ability of VV recombinants to induce pertinent immune responses necessary for protection, the potential to develop polyvalent vaccines, and the successful history of VV as an immunizing agent provide the impetus for engineering VV as a live recombinant vaccine candidate. Critical to the refinement of poxviruses as recombinant immunizing agents is a more in-depth knowledge of the molecular biology of these viruses. Although significant advances have been made in this area within the past 10 years, a greater understanding of the mechanisms governing gene expression and viral virulence factors should enable the development of more safe and effective vaccine candidates. Progression of VV vector technology to other members of the poxvirus family has been successful. Development of other poxviruses as vectors may, therefore, provide a means of generating host-restricted vaccines. Fowlpox recombinant viruses, for instance, may yield candidate vaccines in the poultry industry. Interestingly, it was also demonstrated that these host-restricted recombinant viruses can be used as immunizing vehicles in other species. The ability of a nonreplicating viral vector to elicit a protective immune response is especially intriguing in light of the observation by Morgan et al. that a VV/EBV gp340/220 recombinant, derived from an avirulent VV strain, was unable to protect cottontop tamarins from a live EBV challenge.",1990

The continuous increase in the number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases for whom no effective therapy is currently possible mandates attempts at developing primary prevention by a vaccine. Two basic unknowns are considered important: the identification of virus-exposed, protected individuals; and the isolation of the antigen which contains epitopes which induce a protective response. Although almost all individuals exposed to human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus type III (HTLV-III) develop antibody, most of these do not have neutralizing antibody. The antigen which can induce the response is the major external glycoprotein, which is highly glycosylated (Mr 120,000). Based on past attempts at developing vaccines against retroviruses, the most feasible configuration will be the glycoprotein linked to its transmembrane protein and assembled into micelles or rosettes by hydrophobic bonding. Any virus preparation containing nucleic acids could be considered less safe. An advanced version of such a viral subunit presentation is matrices composed of immunostimulating complexes. This format could also be useful for the inoculation of sequence determined synthetic peptides or genetically engineered readout products of the viral envelope (env) gene. Potential problems exist in that there is extensive heterogeneity among various HTLV-III isolates, particularly in the env gene. This fact and the known relationship of HTLV-III to some lentiviruses suggest that functional antigenic variation could be encountered. The methodology of developing a vaccine against the retroviruses causing AIDS should also be helpful in designing vaccine strategies against human leukemia and lymphomas caused by other members of this virus family.",1985

Analysis of hemagglutination-inhibition reactivity patterns of antigenic variants selected in vitro in the presence of monoclonal antibodies indicated that there were a minimum of six distinct epitopes detectable on the HN molecule. Competitive-binding assays indicated that these epitopes were located in two topologically nonoverlapping antigenic sites. An additional four epitopes were detected when 37 PIV3 clinical strains isolated over a period of 26 years in three geographic regions were tested for reactivity with the antibodies. Of the 10 unique epitopes defined by our monoclonal antibodies, 5 did not undergo detectable antigenic variation in any of the 37 strains examined. These results were expected since PIV3 viruses have been characterized as being antigenically monotypic. In contrast, antigenic variation was detected in the remaining five epitopes. This variation was not characterized by the accumulation of antigenic alterations with time (as for influenza A viruses), but appeared to represent genetic heterogeneity within the PIV3 population.",1985

Immunol. 20, 483-489) for predicting the hydrophilic regions of a given protein. This program will produce a listing of the hydrophilic sequence averages and graphically illustrates the peak areas. The hydrophilic averages over a hexapeptide length can be used to predict protein structure. In conjunction with the Chou-Fasman predictive scheme for protein secondary structure determination, the possible antigenic determinants for the envelope glycoprotein of three viruses isolated from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were predicted. These predicted determinants could be used to generate synthetic peptides that represent a potential vaccine preparation or in developing a diagnostic assay that specifically detects the agent.",1985

Monoclonal antibodies to the haemagglutinin (HA) of the avian H1 influenza virus A/duck/Alberta/35/76 were used to construct an operational antigenic map of the HA molecule and to study the interrelationships of H1 viruses from different hosts. Haemagglutination inhibition tests between the monoclonal antibodies and variants selected by them provided evidence of four antigenic regions which overlap to varying degrees. Avian H1 influenza viruses displayed a spectrum of reactivities to the monoclonal antibody panel. Representatives of the epidemic strains of human H1 influenza viruses and early swine influenza viruses showed little or no reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies but swine influenza-like viruses isolated from pigs and humans in the last decade reacted with 11 of 17 antibodies. The antigenic similarity of these viruses to many avian isolates suggests that there has been a transfer of HA genetic information between mammalian and avian H1 influenza viruses.",1986

Independent isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exhibit a striking genomic diversity, most of which is located in the viral envelope gene. Since this property of the HIV group of viruses may play an important role in the pathobiology of the virus, we analyzed the predicted amino acid sequences of the envelope proteins of seven different HIV strains, three of which represent sequential isolates from a single patient. By using a computer program that predicts the secondary protein structure and superimposes values for hydrophilicity, surface probability, and flexibility, we identified several potential antigenic epitopes in the envelope proteins of the seven different viruses. Interestingly, the majority of the predicted epitopes in the exterior envelope protein (gp120) were found in regions of high sequence variability which are interspersed with highly conserved regions among the independent viral isolates. A comparison of the sequential viral isolates revealed that changes concerning the secondary structure of the protein occurred only in regions which were predicted to be antigenic, predominantly in highly variable regions. The membrane-associated protein gp41 contains no highly variable regions; about 80% of the amino acids were found to be conserved, and only one hydrophilic area was identified as likely to be accessible to antibody recognition. These findings give insight into the secondary and possible tertiary structure of variant HIV envelope proteins and should facilitate experimental approaches directed toward the identification and fine mapping of HIV envelope proteins.",1987

Much effort has been devoted to the analysis of antibodies to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus antigens, but no studies, to our knowledge, have defined antigenic sites of this virus that elicit T-cell immunity, even though such immunity is important in protection against many other viruses. T cells tend to recognize only a limited number of discrete sites on a protein antigen. Analysis of immunodominant helper T-cell sites has suggested that such sites tend to form amphipathic helices. An algorithm based on this model was used to identify two candidate T-cell sites, env T1 and env T2, in the envelope protein of human T-lymphotropic virus type IIIB that were conserved in other human immunodeficiency virus isolates. Corresponding peptides were synthesized and studied in genetically defined inbred and F1 mice for induction of lymph node proliferation. After immunization with a 426-residue recombinant envelope protein fragment, significant responses to native gp 120, as well as to each peptide, were observed in both F1 combinations studied. Conversely, immunization with env T1 peptide induced T-cell immunity to the native gp 120 envelope protein. The genetics of the response to env T1 peptide were further examined and revealed a significant response in three of four independent major histocompatibility haplotypes tested, an indication of high frequency responsiveness in the population. Identification of helper T-cell sites should facilitate development of a highly immunogenic, carrier-free vaccine that induces T-cell and B-cell immunity. The ability to elicit T-cell immunity to the native viral protein by immunization with a 16-residue peptide suggests that such sites represent potentially important components of an effective vaccine for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.",1987

We describe experiments using the swine herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus (PRV), as a vector for expression of hybrid membrane protein genes. In particular, we present the construction and analysis of three infectious PRV mutants expressing chimeric viral membrane proteins composed of portions of the PRV envelope glycoprotein gIII and of the human retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41. All of the chimeric genes contain the transcription control sequences and the first 157 codons of PRV gIII (known to contain signals sufficient for efficient export of the encoded peptide out of the cell) fused to different regions of the HIV-1 envelope. The mutant viruses express novel glycosylated fusion proteins that are immunoprecipitated by polyvalent sera specific for gIII, as well as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patient sera. The levels of expression are lower than expected due primarily to instability or altered processing of the hybrid mRNA. We could not detect cleavage of chimeric proteins carrying the gp120-gp41 protease processing site. The use of localization signals contained within herpesvirus membrane proteins to direct chimeric proteins to desired cellular locations is discussed.",1988

This response could not be detected earlier than 8 days postinoculation but could be detected up to 28 days after exposure to CB3. CVB3-sensitized splenocytes responded not only to the CVB3 antigen but to other enteroviruses as well. This response was found to be enterovirus specific in that no response was detected to a non-enteroviral picornavirus, encephalomyocarditis virus, or to an unrelated influenza virus. The generation of a splenocyte population capable of responding to an enterovirus group antigen(s) was not limited to inoculation of mice with CVB3, as similar responses were generated when mice were inoculated with CVB2. Cell subset depletions revealed that the major cell type responding to the enterovirus group antigen(s) was the CD4+ T cell. Current evidence suggests that the group antigen(s) resides in the structural proteins of the virus, since spleen cells from mice inoculated with a UV-inactivated, highly purified preparation of CVB3 virions also responded in vitro against enteroviral antigens.",1989

In particular, salmonella strains harbouring mutations in genes involved in the pre-chorismate biosynthetic pathway make excellent oral vaccines evoking strong humoral, local and cellular immune responses in the host. Because of the spectrum of immune responses induced by live vaccine strains they have the potential to be used for delivery of heterologous antigens to the mammalian immune system.

Groups of susceptible white rock chickens and racing homing pigeons were vaccinated subcutaneously with one of the vaccines, and their serologic responses were determined using the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test at frequent intervals up to 9 weeks postvaccination. Pigeons were challenged after 10 weeks with a virulent PPMV-1 isolate given intravenously, observed for signs of disease for 5 weeks, and then tested for secondary serologic HI responses. The HI responses were measured using the three strains of virus as HI test antigens. The titers were generally greater when the hemagglutination antigen used in the test was homologous with the antigen used to prepare the vaccine.

A technique for delivering genes carried by recombinant retroviruses into specific cell types could have numerous applications in oncology, developmental biology, and gene therapy. As a first step toward this remote goal we designed a procedure allowing in vitro cell targeting by retroviruses. Biotinylated antibodies against the viral envelope protein on one side, and against specific cell membrane markers on the other side, were bridged by streptavidin and used to link the virus to the host. The method was successfully used to infect human cells with ecotropic murine retroviruses by means of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigens and appears easily adaptable to other cell membrane markers. Moreover, the sequential protocol we designed, although allowing infection of human cells, requires less stringent safety constraints than would handling of amphotropic virus stocks.",1989

As a major cause of acute and chronic liver disease as well as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to pose significant health problems world-wide. Recombinant hepatitis B vaccines based on adenovirus vectors have been developed to address global needs for effective control of hepatitis B infection. Although considerable progress has been made in the construction of recombinant adenoviruses that express large amounts of HBV gene products, preclinical immunogenicity and efficacy testing of candidate vaccines has remained difficult due to the lack of a suitable animal model. We demonstrate here that chimpanzees are susceptible to enteric infection by human adenoviruses type 7 (Ad7) and type 4 (Ad4) following oral administration of live virus. Moreover, after sequential oral immunization with Ad7- and Ad4-vectored vaccines containing the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) gene, significant antibody responses to HBsAg (anti-HBs) were induced in two chimpanzees. After challenge with heterologous HBV, one chimpanzee was protected from acute hepatitis and the other chimpanzee experienced modified HBV-induced disease.

Viruses were administered per os to larvae of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, causing an infection that within 5 days resulted in the production of approximately 0.15 mg of HBsAg per insect, representing 1.5% of the total extracted protein, or approximately 2.8 mg of NA per insect, representing 28% of the total extractable protein. The HBsAg and NA produced by infected larvae were purified from insect lysates. These proteins were antigenic as determined by conformation-dependent immunoassays. The NA was enzymatically active with conventional substrates. The method of infection described allows genetic complementation by wild-type virus of recombinant viruses lacking the polyhedrin gene essential for infection per os and has implications for the high-yield production in insect larvae of other recombinant proteins of baculoviruses.",1989

Sites 2 and 3 localize to the N-terminal half of M1. Antigenic variation of M proteins was seen when the monoclonal antibodies were tested against 14 strains of type A influenza viruses. Several monoclonal antibodies showed specific recognition of A/PR/8/34 and A/USSR/90/77 M proteins and little or no reactivity for all other strains tested. Immunofluorescence analysis with the monoclonal antibodies showed migration of M protein to the nucleus during the replicative cycle and demonstrated association of M protein with actin filaments in the cytoplasm.

The biology of HIV is complex and very little is known regarding the host immune defenses against viral infection. The virus has evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system which would appear to make traditional vaccine approaches potentially inadequate. However, all of the diverse technologies which have recently been developed in the field of vaccinology have already been applied in large measure to this disease. These techniques include the use of subunits derived from the virus or by recombinant DNA methods, the use of peptides, the use of anti-idiotypes, and the use of various attenuated viruses which can be utilized as gene carriers.

The two vaccines were estimated to contain approximately the same amount of gp70 antigen and the cats were immunized three times according to the recommendations of the commercial vaccine. A control preparation not containing gp70 or p15E was also included. During the observation period of 200 days all cats remained healthy and no virus was isolated during the isolation attempts. The serological responses were measured in ELISA, membrane immunofluorescence (MIF) and virus neutralization (VN) tests. In contrast to the cats in the other groups almost all ISCOM-vaccinated cats responded by seroconversion or increased titres in the three tests. The development of specific antibodies to gp70 and p15E were confirmed in Western blot.

A single-gene substitution reassortant 11-1 was generated from two porcine rotaviruses, OSU (serotype 5) and Gottfried (serotype 4). This reassortant derived 10 genes, including gene 4 encoding VP3, from the OSU strain and only gene 9, encoding a major neutralization glycoprotein (VP7), from the Gottfried strain and was thus designated VP3:5; VP7:4. Oral administration of this reassortant to colostrum-deprived gnotobiotic newborn pigs induced a high level of neutralizing antibodies not only to Gottfried VP7 but also to OSU VP3, thus demonstrating that VP3 is as potent an immunogen as VP7 in inducing neutralizing antibodies during experimental oral infection. Gnotobiotic piglets infected previously with the reassortant were completely resistant to oral challenge with the virulent Gottfried strain (VP3:4; VP7:4), as indicated by failure of symptoms to develop and lack of virus shedding. Similarly, prior infection with the reassortant induced almost complete protection against diarrhea and significant restriction of virus replication after oral challenge with the virulent OSU strain (VP3:5; VP7:5). Thus, it appears that (i) the immune system of the piglet responds equally well to two rotavirus outer capsid proteins, VP3 and VP7, during primary enteric rotavirus infection; (ii) antibody to VP3 and antibody to VP7 are each associated with resistance to diarrhea; and (iii) infection with a reassortant rotavirus bearing VP3 and VP7 neutralization antigens derived from two viruses of different serotype induces immunity to both parental viruses.

Plasmid vectors have been constructed which allow the construction of infectious fowlpox virus (FPV) recombinants expressing foreign genes. The foreign genes were inserted within the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of FPV contained in these vectors. To facilitate the selection of recombinants the Escherichia coli xanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (Ecogpt) gene was developed as a dominant selectable marker. This marker operates in a wide variety of cell types and obviates the need for TK- cell lines for selection of TK- recombinants when foreign genes have been inserted within the TK gene of FPV. The general approach adopted was to construct plasmid vectors in which the FPV TK was interrupted by the Ecogpt gene under the control of a poxvirus promoter in tandem with a gene of interest under the control of another poxvirus promoter. Selection of viruses expressing the Ecogpt gene simultaneously selects for recombinants carrying both the Ecogpt gene and the gene of interest. Using this approach a series of plasmid vectors was constructed in which the FPV TK gene was interrupted by the Ecogpt gene under the control of the P7.5 vaccinia virus promoter in tandem with the A/PR/8/34 haemagglutinin gene under the control of the PL11 vaccinia virus promoter. A recombinant FPV constructed using these plasmids had the expected genome arrangement, expressed influenza haemagglutinin, and induced haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies when inoculated into chickens. These techniques should allow the construction of a variety of recombinant FPVs expressing poultry vaccine antigens. Such recombinants should be a very cost-effective means of delivering vaccines to poultry.",1988

A number of new recombinant DNA approaches are now being tried to improve the production and the presentation of antigens. One method is to use a carrier protein encoded by a retrotransposon of yeast called the Ty element. This protein can be linked to a wide range of viral antigens via the construction of hybrid genes. The fusion proteins assemble in yeast into 60 nm virus-like particles (VLPs) that display the additional antigens on the surface.

Also the viral protein remains in the high mannose form throughout the chase period. These results do not reflect a general impairment of terminal glycosylation of membrane proteins. Immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that in virally infected cells E19 and class I antigens accumulate in the perinuclear region. Class I antigens gradually disappear from the cell surface.

Monospecific antiserum (to bovine rotavirus, NCDV strain) or a set of monoclonal antibodies to the major outer capsid neutralization glycoprotein, VP7 (of the rhesus rotavirus), was used to select for reassortants with human rotavirus neutralization specificity. This selection technique yielded many reassortants which received only the gene segment coding for the major neutralization protein from the human rotavirus parent, whereas the remaining genes were derived from the animal rotavirus parent. Single human rotavirus gene substitution reassortants of this sort represent potential live vaccine strains.",1985

We have used a generalized adenovirus vector system to express the three polyoma tumor (T) antigen proteins under the control of the adenovirus major late promoter. One hybrid virus, Ad-PySVR498, expresses high levels of polyoma middle and small T antigens. A second hybrid virus, Ad-LTSVR545, which contains a cDNA copy of the polyoma A gene, overproduces large T antigen. The T antigens produced are indistinguishable from their authentic polyoma counterparts as determined by immunoprecipitation and partial cleavage by V8 protease. Analysis of polyoma mRNAs encoded by the recombinant viruses showed that they initiate from the adenovirus major late promoter and contain the tripartite leader at their 5' ends. Large T antigen isolated from Ad-LTSVR545-infected cells by immunoaffinity was shown to bind selectively to polyoma DNA sequences that contain the origin of viral DNA replication as well as the sites for transcription initiation.",1985

DNA fragments containing an open reading frame known to encode most or all of the EBNA1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were fused in the proper transcriptional orientation to the promoter regulatory domain, capping site, and a portion of the 5' transcribed noncoding sequences of the HSV-1 alpha 4 gene of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). In these constructs 20, 130, or 385 bp of EBV DNA and 28 bp of HSV-1 DNA separated the alpha 4 cap site from a putative initiator codon of the EBNA1 gene. The chimeric alpha 4-EBNA1 genes were introduced into L cells or recombined into the viral genome using the thymidine kinase selection system. The three chimeric gene constructs resident in the L cell clones expressed a protein indistinguishable from authentic EBNA1 with respect to electrophoretic and immunologic properties indicating that the ATG at the beginning of the EBV open reading frame initiated translation of the bonafide EBNA1 protein. The chimeric alpha 4-EBNA1 genes resident in L cells were induced by HSV-1 infection and were regulated as alpha genes. The chimeric alpha 4-EBNA1 gene recombined into the viral genome was also regulated as an alpha gene. The recombinant viruses were stable and expressed 50- to 100-fold more EBNA1 than is ordinarily expressed in human lymphocytes carrying the EBV genome. EBNA1 did not alter the program of HSV-1 protein expression. The utility of the vector is discussed.",1986

These two viruses direct the synthesis of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) particles during the time course of an infectious cycle. When the pre-S2 region is present in the constructed virus, the synthesis of particles carrying the receptor for polymerized human serum albumin (pHSA) is observed.

Infection with the retrovirus that is the etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by the development of antiviral antibodies. To generate reagents for studying immune responses to individual viral proteins, we have produced viral antigens in microorganisms by recombinant DNA techniques. Large amounts of the major core protein (p25gag) of an isolate of the AIDS retrovirus (AIDS-associated retrovirus; ARV-2) have been directly expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant p25gag (R-p25gag) has been purified and used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to p25gag. Serum samples obtained from 100 individuals with AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), or potential exposure to the virus through sexual contact with AIDS or ARC patients (contacts) were tested first in an ELISA with disrupted whole virus to determine which of the subjects had mounted an antibody response to the virus (virus seropositive) and then in the p25gag ELISA to determine if they had antibodies to this particular viral antigen. We observed a decrease in the proportion of virus seropositive individuals with antibodies to p25gag among patients groups in which the disease was more advanced; contacts were often positive (71%), ARC patients less frequently positive (48%), and AIDS patients only rarely positive (16%). Our results suggest that monitoring p25gag seropositivity of infected individuals may be useful for predicting either the prognosis or the stage of the disease.",1986

Viruses were recovered from HeLa S3 cells and African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cells transfected with an infectious cDNA clone of poliovirus vaccine Sabin 1 strain. The viruses recovered from the different DNA-transfected cells were tested for the biological characteristics of temperature sensitivity (rct marker), plaque size, and bicarbonate concentration dependency (d marker). The results revealed that the above properties were similar to those obtained from tests on the Sabin 1 vaccine reference strain. The recovered viruses and the vaccine reference virus were passaged in AGMK cells at an elevated temperature of 37.5 degrees, and the passaged isolates were tested for the rct marker. The virus recovered from AGMK cells had the most stable rct phenotype while the virus from HeLa S3 cells had a similar stability to that of the reference virus, suggesting that the virus from AGMK cells would be more suitable as a vaccine strain than the other two viruses. Furthermore, an infectious cDNA clone of high specific infectivity, constructed by introducing SV40 large T antigen into the plasmid, was used for production of high titers of virus after transfection. The results of in vitro biological tests on the recovered virus suggested that virus produced in the transfected AGMK cells also had the high quality that is desirable in vaccine stocks. Monkey neurovirulence tests performed with these recovered viruses revealed that the recovered viruses were weakly neurovirulent, similar to the vaccine reference virus. The infectious cDNA clone of the poliovirus vaccine strain could therefore be used to generate a possible inoculum of the oral polio live vaccine. Our findings strongly suggest that an infectious cDNA clone of poliovirus RNA may be used to preserve the constancy and quality of the present seed viruses of the Sabin 1 vaccine strain.",1986

Subsequently, these recombinants were used to generate cell lines that produced defective helper-free retroviruses carrying each of the viral oncogenes. These recombinant retroviruses were used to analyze the role of the viral genes in transformation of rat F111 cells. Expression of the polyomavirus middle T antigen alone resulted in cell lines that were highly tumorigenic, whereas expression of the polyomavirus large T resulted in cell lines that were highly tumorigenic, whereas expression of the polyomavirus large T resulted in cell lines that were unaltered by the criteria of morphology, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity. More surprisingly, SV40 large T-expressing cell lines were not tumorigenic despite the fact that they contained elevated levels of cellular p53 and had a high plating efficiency in soft agar. These results suggest that the SV40 large T antigen is not an acute transforming gene like the polyomavirus middle T antigen but is similar to the establishment genes such as myc and adenovirus EIa.",1986

In these vectors, an internal simian virus 40 or human metallothionein promoter sequence serves to drive the expression of the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase or guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase genes, whereas the viral long terminal repeat sequences are utilized to promote expression of inserted sequences. In some of the vectors, the viral 5' splice site, normally used in the biogenesis of the subgenomic env-encoding mRNA, has been eliminated. These vectors yield high transient and stable titers of virus after transfection of viral packaging cell lines, show little or no depression of virus titer with a variety of inserts, and faithfully transmit recombinant proviral sequences to recipient cells. To characterize the expression potential of these vectors, a variety of inserts encoding the alpha and beta subunits of the human major histocompatibility complex class II antigen HLA-DR have been introduced into these vectors. NIH 3T3 cells infected by viruses containing HLA-DR alpha or beta cDNAs express these proteins as shown by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled extracts. In addition, through the sequential infection of cells with retrovirus constructions expressing two different selectable markers, both subunits of the class II antigen have been introduced into NIH 3T3 cells.

Reactivity with monospecific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies suggested that VP6, expressed intracellularly or found in the media, maintained native antigenic determinants. VP6 purified from the media from infected cells also possessed a native oligomeric structure, was immunogenic in guinea pigs, and was able to spontaneously assemble into morphologic subunits.

Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected with either of the derived recombinant plasmids in the presence of infectious AcNPV DNA yielded recombinant, polyhedrin-negative viruses that expressed high levels of the respective HBpcAg or HBcAg (representing approx. 5 to 10% and approx. 40% of the stained cellular proteins, respectively). The particulate 27 nm HBcAgs have been purified to homogeneity from infected cell extracts by density gradient centrifugation. Dual expression transfer vectors containing the HBcAg gene sequences and the coding sequences of the HB viral S antigen (HBsAg), each gene under the control of its own copy of the polyhedrin promoter, have also been constructed and used to derive recombinant viruses.

Live attenuated strains of salmonellae are showing promise as live oral vaccines against human typhoid fever and other Salmonella infections of man and animals. Attenuation can be achieved by introducing genetically defined, non-reverting mutations into specific genes on the Salmonella chromosome. Mutations in the gal E or aroA genes of Salmonella inhibit the ability of the bacteria to grow in vivo, and strains carrying such lesions are effective vaccines against salmonellosis. Genetic determinants encoding for the expression of potentially protective antigens from heterologous, non-Salmonella pathogens can be readily introduced into these attenuated Salmonella strains. Expression of the heterologous antigen does not affect the ability of the Salmonella host to be used as a Salmonella vaccine. Mice infected orally with a Salmonella typhimurium aroA vaccine expressing the Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin B subunit developed both a secretory and serum antibody response to this antigen. These serum antibodies were able to neutralise the activity of E. coli heat-labile toxin in tissue culture assays. A humoral and cell-mediated (DTH) immune response was detected against beta galactosidase, an intracellular antigen, in mice infected with an aroA vaccine expressing this cloned antigen. The prospects for the development of live Salmonella vaccines as a method for delivering heterologous antigens derived from bacteria, viruses and parasites is discussed.",1987

These influenza A reassortant virus vaccines also express the ca and temperature sensitivity (ts) phenotypes in vitro, but the genes of the ca virus parent which specify the ca, ts, and attenuation (att) phenotypes have not adequately been defined. To identify the genes associated with each of these phenotypes, we isolated six single-gene substitution reassortant viruses, each of which inherited only one RNA segment from the ca parent virus and the remaining seven RNA segments from the A/Korea/1/82 (H3N2) wild-type virus parent. These were evaluated in vitro for their ca and ts phenotypes and in ferrets, hamsters, and seronegative adult volunteers for the att phenotype. We found that the polymerase PA gene of the ca parent specifies the ca phenotype and that the PB2 and PB1 genes independently specify the ts phenotype. The PA, M, PB2, and PB1 genes of the ca donor virus each contribute to the att phenotype. The finding that four genes of the ca donor virus contribute to the att phenotype provides a partial explanation for the observed phenotypic stability of ca reassortant viruses following replication in humans.",1988

This idiotype was identified on other monoclonal antibodies specific for various influenza HAs (H3 and H1). Study of the variable-region (V) genes of these monoclonal antibodies showed that its expression is independent of variable kappa (VK)21 light-chains and that the heavy-chains of the strongly idiotype-positive hybridomas derive from either the variable heavy (VH) J558 or VH 7183 family.

In limiting dilution studies approximately 10% of the influenza CTL response is HA-specific, while approximately 30% of the response is NP-specific. Despite the ability of NP to stimulate a significant CTL response, mice immunised with the NP-vaccinia recombinant are not as well protected from subsequent lethal challenge with influenza virus, as mice immunised with the HA vaccinia recombinant.

A clone, pWS23, encompassing the entire surface and X genes of WHV was isolated. Comparison of the complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of pWS23 with those of genomic DNAs from two different WHV isolates showed that it contained a nearly full-length copy of the major mRNA encoding the viral surface antigen (S mRNA). It was colinear with the WHV genome over 1858 nt and terminated 22 nt downstream from the variant polyadenylation signal within the core gene. Evidence for heterogeneity of the 5'-terminal region of the S mRNA came from direct sequencing of the 5' extremities of 20 cDNA inserts, similar to that of pWS23, isolated from a second cDNA library of the same woodchuck liver. In agreement with previous mapping studies of hepadnaviruses, two main initiation regions of S mRNA were localized 27-30 nt upstream and 22-49 nt downstream from the pre-S2 initiation codon.

In one type of hybrid virus only the adenovirus 2 major late promoter, including just 33 base pairs of the adenovirus type 2 tripartite leader, preceded the coding region of the HBsAg gene. In another, this region was preceded by both the adenovirus major late promoter and almost the entire tripartite leader. The structure of the substituted sequence in each of the recombinant viral DNAs was identical to that in the plasmids used to construct the viruses. Approximately equivalent amounts of HBsAg-specific mRNA were produced late in infection with each recombinant virus. Although HBsAg production was detected late in infection of the hybrid virus not containing the full tripartite leader sequence, its level was 1/70th of that obtained with the hybrid virus containing this sequence. One likely interpretation is that the presence of the tripartite leader at the 5' end of this mRNA is critical for the synthesis of HBsAg polypeptide in the late stage of infection.

We found that murine cells infected with this virus were efficiently lysed in a major histocompatibility complex-restricted manner by cross-reactive CTL populations obtained by immunization with a variety of influenza A virus subtypes. In addition, the recombinant vaccinia virus containing the PR8 NP gene was able to both stimulate and prime for a vigorous secondary cross-reactive CTL response. Significantly, splenocytes from mice primed by inoculation with the recombinant vaccinia virus containing the PR8 NP gene could be stimulated by influenza A viruses of all three major human subtypes.

Overall, the best method of cold adaptation to develop a live virus vaccine line appeared to be a stepwise lowering of the growth temperature allowing time for multiple lesions to occur and/or be selected. In addition, the starting virus should be a recent isolate not as yet adapted to a tissue culture host and the cold-adaptation process should then occur in a host heterologous to the virus' normal host.

This association occurs both in adenovirus-infected cells and in cells that have been transfected with the gene encoding the E3/19K protein. The formation of the HLA-E3/19K complex prevents the HLA antigens from being correctly processed by inhibiting their terminal glycosylation. This effect is specific for HLA antigens and does not generally involve the glycosyltransferases. Furthermore, the HLA-E3/19K association dramatically reduces the cell surface expression of the HLA antigens. This reduced level of antigens might influence the cytotoxic T cell response.

We placed the SV40 early region within this DNA and after transfection of cells producing helper Moloney murine leukemia virus, SV40 retroviruses (MV40) could be rescued. Cytoplasmic spliced large T and small t transcripts, as well as unspliced transcripts, are packaged into virions with equal efficiency. Pure SV40 large T retroviruses can be cloned from these heterogeneous virus stocks by secondary transformation of rodent cells. The large T retrovirus stocks morphologically transform primary or established mouse and rat lines with high efficiency. There is little difference in transformation either by agar assay or focus formation between retroviruses carrying both SV40 genes or large T alone. We present quantitative data that demonstrate that abortive transformation of rodent cells by SV40, transient expression of the transformed phenotype after infection, is not manifested by MV40. Thus abortive transformation is not the result of a weakly dominant transforming gene, but rather of the normally inefficient mode of integration and early gene expression of SV40 upon infection of rodent cells.",1984

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Wa VP7 protein to the sequences of simian SA11 and UK bovine VP7 proteins shows that the majority of the amino acid differences are clustered between amino acid residues 37 through 49, 65 through 75, 87 through 105, 122 through 126, 146 through 149, 178 through 181, and 208 through 242. A hydrophilicity profile of the three proteins reveals correlations between hydrophilic peaks, potentially antigenic determinants, and certain clusters of amino acid changes.",1984
"96","s100914","genetically engineered poxviruses: a novel approach to the construction of live vaccines.","genetically engineered poxviruses: a novel approach to the construction of live vaccines.. Gene splicing techniques have been used to modify the smallpox vaccine virus thus providing a generic approach for the construction of live vaccines directed against a variety of heterologous infectious disease agents. The technique involves translocating a particular gene from an infectious agent into the genetic material of the smallpox vaccine virus. This unique foreign gene, selected because it contains the information essential for the synthesis of an antigen important in immunity to that particular infectious disease agent, is now expressed under the regulation of the engineered smallpox vaccine virus. On immunization with this live recombinant vaccine, the body is fooled into thinking that it was infected by the foreign infectious disease agent and mounts a defensive attack resulting in immunity to that particular infectious agent. Three examples of this approach are provided. Thus, smallpox vaccine viruses were engineered to express genes encoding the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (HSV-gD) and the haemagglutinin (HA) from influenza virus. These foreign gene products when synthesized in vitro under vaccinia virus regulation were shown to be antigenic by a variety of serological tests. When these recombinant vaccinia viruses were inoculated into laboratory animals, the heterologous gene products elicited the production of specific antibodies thus demonstrating that they were immunogenic. Serum neutralizing antibodies were demonstrated to be present for both influenza and herpes simplex viruses. Additional studies in mice showed that a recombinant smallpox vaccine virus expressing a gene from herpes simplex virus effectively protected the mice when subsequently challenged with what would normally be lethal doses of infectious herpes simplex virus.",1984
"97","s101255","recombinant dna technology for the preparation of subunit vaccines.","recombinant dna technology for the preparation of subunit vaccines.. Recombinant DNA technology appears to be on the verge of producing safe and effective protein vaccines for animal and human diseases. The procedure is applicable to most viruses because their isolated surface proteins generally possess immunogenic activity. Strategies used for the preparation and cloning of the appropriate genes depend on the characteristics of the viral genomes: whether DNA or RNA; their size, strandedness, and segmentation; and whether messenger RNA are monocistronic or polycistronic. Cloned surface proteins of foot-and-mouth disease and hepatitis B viruses are being tested for possible use as practical vaccines. Two doses of the cloned foot-and-mouth disease viral protein have elicited large amounts of neutralizing antibody and have protected cattle and swine against challenge exposure with the virus. Surface proteins have also been cloned for the viruses of fowl plague, influenza, vesicular stomatitis, rabies, and herpes simplex. Cloning is in progress for surface proteins of viruses causing canine parvovirus gastroenteritis, human papillomas, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Rift Valley fever, and paramyxovirus diseases. In addition, advances in recombinant DNA and other facilitating technologies have rekindled interest in the chemical synthesis of polypeptide vaccines for viral diseases. The bioengineering of bacterial vaccines is also under way. Proteinaceous pili of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are being produced in E coli K-12 strains for use as vaccines against neonatal diarrheal diseases of livestock.",1982
"98","s101713","antigenic variation of influenza a virus nucleoprotein detected with monoclonal antibodies.","antigenic variation of influenza a virus nucleoprotein detected with monoclonal antibodies.. Monoclonal antibodies were used to study antigenic variation in the nucleoprotein of influenza A viruses. We found that the nucleoprotein molecule of the WSN/33 strain possesses at least five different determinants. Viruses of other influenza A virus subtypes showed antigenic variation in these nucleoprotein determinants, although changes in only one determinant were detected in H0N1 and animal strains. The nucleoprotein of human strains isolated from 1933 through 1979 could be divided into six groups, based on their reactivities with monoclonal antibodies; these groups did not correlate with any particular hemagglutinin or neuraminidase subtype. Our results indicate that antigenic variation in the nucleoproteins of influenza A viruses proceeds independently of changes in the viral surface antigens and suggest that point mutations and genetic reassortment may account for nucleoprotein variability.",1980
"99","s101906","antigenic structure of influenza virus haemagglutinin defined by hybridoma antibodies.","antigenic structure of influenza virus haemagglutinin defined by hybridoma antibodies.. The recurrence of influenza virus infection in man is attributed primarily to changes occurring in the antigenic structure of the viral surface glycoproteins, especially of the haemagglutinin (HA) molecule. Comparative antigenic analysis of epidemic influenza virus strains has allowed the description of 'strain-specific' and 'cross-reactive' antigenic determinants. However, the interpretation of these findings remained ambiguous, because the specificity of the applied antisera was insufficiently defined and because the antigenic differences among the HA molecules of various epidemic virus strains resulted presumably from a large number of amino acid substitutions. Thus, in characterizing the antigenic structure of the HA molecule, our approach has been (1) to generate a panel of monoclonal anti-HA hybridoma antibodies, (2) to use some of these antibodies to select mutants of the influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8) virus expressing antigenically altered HA molecules, and (3) to construct an operational antigenic map of the HA molecule by comparative antigenic analysis of the mutant viruses with the monoclonal antibodies. As we report here, analysis of the 34 mutant viruses selected has enabled us to define four antigenic sites on the HA molecule. Our observation that these sites have undergone antigenic drift to a different extent in nature implies that the mechanisms responsible for antigenic drift act selectively on distinct structures of the HA molecule.",1981
"100","s102663","characterization of an antigenic determinant of the glycoprotein that correlates with pathogenicity of rabies virus.","characterization of an antigenic determinant of the glycoprotein that correlates with pathogenicity of rabies virus.. The pathogenicity of fixed rabies virus strains for adult mice depends on the presence of an antigenic determinant on the viral glycoprotein. Two virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been used to identify this determinant. All pathogenic strains of fixed rabies virus bind to these antibodies and are neutralized by them, whereas nonpathogenic strains fail to react with these monoclonal antibodies and are not neutralized by them. Antigenic variants of the rabies virus with altered glycoprotein were selected by growing virus in the presence of one monoclonal antibody, 194-2. All variants that lost their ability to react with this antibody and an additional antibody, 248-8, were found to be nonpathogenic for adult mice. Analysis of tryptic peptides of the glycoproteins of pathogenic parent virus and nonpathogenic variants and the amino acid sequence of a specific variant tryptic peptide revealed that the change in pathogenicity corresponded to an amino acid substitution at position 333 of the glycoprotein molecule. The nucleotide sequence of the nonpathogenic variant glycoprotein gene contained a base change that confirmed the single amino acid substitution in the tryptic peptide replacing arginine-333 in the parental glycoprotein. We conclude that arginine-333 is essential for the integrity of an antigenic determinant and for the ability of rabies viruses to produce lethal infection in adult mice.",1983

As first generation hepatitis B vaccines are derived from human plasma, detailed information is required concerning the elimination of hepatitis B virus and other potential transmissible infectious agents during vaccine preparation. To demonstrate the safety of a hepatitis B vaccine, the efficiency of each of the six main steps used in the preparation process to remove or destroy pathogens was determined for representatives of major groups of animal viruses. Infectivity of all the tested viruses was reduced 10(5)-fold to a factor of 10(9)-fold by the first and last steps, namely PEG fractionation and formalin treatment. The four successive zonal ultracentrifugations decreased virus infectivity by at least 10(7)-fold. Five of these steps tend also to purify the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which increases the HBsAg: protein ratio by at least 10(5)-fold. Considering the high degree of purity obtained, checked on each batch, it is concluded that the procedure consistently eliminates any potential virus with a ide safety margin.",1984

Antibodies specific for the amino- and carboxy-terminal portions of simian virus 40 large tumor (T) antigen were obtained by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions. The amino-terminal synthetic peptide has the sequence Ac-Met-Asp-Lys-Val-Leu-Asn-Arg-(Tyr). The tyrosine residue was introduced in order to couple the peptide to bovine serum albumin with bis-diazotized benzidine. The carboxy-terminal peptide has the sequence Lys-Pro-Pro-Thr-Pro-Pro-Pro-Glu-Pro-Glu-Thr. It was coupled to bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde. The antisera against both peptides reacted with large T antigen. The specificity of the immune reaction was demonstrated by inhibition experiments using excess synthetic peptides. Furthermore, fragments of T antigen encoded by the nondefective adenovirus 2-simian virus 40 hybrid viruses Ad2+ND2 and Ad2+ND4, which contain the carboxy terminus and lack the amino terminus of large T antigen, were precipitated only with antiserum to the carboxy-terminal peptide. Small T antigen was not precipitated with either serum, suggesting that the amino terminus of small T antigen has a conformation different from that of large T antigen or that it is sterically hindered by a host protein. The procedures used here are of general importance for identification and characterization of gene product.",1980

In principle, several avenues for attenuation of herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are now available.

Results of analyses of HSV-1 x HSV-2 recombinants and of mutants containing a deletion in a gene expressed early in infection showed a loss of virulence when infected by intracerebral route into adult Balb/c mice.

We have constructed four novel adenovirus-SV40 hybrid viruses that contain the SV40 A gene at different positions downstream from the adenoviral major late promoter, within the region that encodes the second and third segments of the late tripartite RNA leader. The SV40 insert was precisely positioned in preselected regions of the adenoviral genome by using a combination of in vitro and in vivo recombination. As expected, all four recombinants produce equally high levels of SV40-encoded RNA that initiates at the adenovirus late promoter and contains two or three leader segments at the 5' end. Yet, in spite of this efficient transcription, only one virus, Ad-SVR284, directs the synthesis of high levels of SV40 large T antigen in infected cells; the other recombinants all produce approximately 20-fold less T antigen. This differential expression is, however, not seen in vitro, where equal amounts of hybrid T mRNA direct the synthesis of equal amounts of SV40 T antigen. Thus, some form of translational regulation is present in adenovirus-infected cells that is missing from the in vitro translation reaction.",1983

The biological activity of these poxvirus vectors was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Expression of HA in cells infected with recombinant vaccinia was detected by using specific anti-HA antiserum and 125I-labeled protein A, showing that HA synthesized under the regulation of vaccinia virus was antigenic. Immunization of rabbits with these recombinant poxviruses resulted in the production of antibodies reactive with authentic influenza HA as detected by radioimmunoassay, by inhibition of HA erythrocyte agglutination, and by neutralization of influenza virus infectivity. The production of antibodies directed against influenza HA suggested that the HA gene expressed in vaccinia is immunogenic.

The HBsAg synthesized in vitro under the regulation of vaccinia virus is secreted from infected cells as a particle of approximately equal to 22 nm diameter with a density of 1.2 g/ml as determined on CsCl gradients. Inoculation of rabbits with the recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses the HBsAg elicits the production of high-titered antibodies. Synthesis of the HSV-gD was detected in tissue culture by radioimmunoassay on unfixed cells, suggesting that the HSV-gD synthesized by the recombinant vaccinia virus is membrane associated. Inoculation of rabbits with the recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HSV-gD resulted in the production of antibodies that reacted with authentic HSV-gD as detected by radioimmunoassay. Furthermore, the anti-serum was shown by plaque-reduction assay to neutralize the infectivity of herpes simplex virus.

Genomic analysis revealed that these new variants were almost exclusively nonrecombinant H1N1 viruses, i.e., they contained no genes of H3N2 origin. However, a few recombinant viruses containing the new variant HA and genes of H3N2 origin were identified. Antigenic analysis of H3N2 viruses indicated that they were also heterogeneous. The majority of these virus isolates were antigenically intermediate between A/Texas/1/77 and A/Bangkok/1/79, but additional variants were detected. Genomic analysis revealed that the H3N2 viruses isolated in the winter of 1980-81 were quite similar to H3N2 viruses isolated from 1977-79 in their T(1) oligonucleotide maps. No H1N1 genes were detected in H3N2 virus isolates. Comparison of pairs of oligonucleotide maps of total virus RNA indicated that a similar rate of genetic change had occurred for nonrecombinant H1N1 viruses, for recombinant H1N1 viruses, and for H3N2 viruses and that, in general, pairs of viruses exhibited increasing numbers of changes in their oligonucleotide maps as the time interval between isolation of the viruses increased.",1983

The relationships of various polypeptides associated with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), ground squirrel hepatitis surface antigen (GSHsAg), woodchuck hepatitis surface antigen (WHsAg), and duck hepatitis B surface antigen (DHBsAg) were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and tryptic peptide mapping. Analysis of independent antigen isolates by SDS-PAGE resulted in bands consistently observed at 24,000, 28,000, 32,000, 43,000, and 50,000 Da with HBsAg; at 22,000, 25,000, 35,000, 37,000, 39,000, and 42,000 Da with GSHsAg and WHsAg; and at 18,500, 30,000, and 38,500, Da with DHBsAg. Comparison of the major polypeptide pair from the mammalian viruses by tryptic peptide mapping suggests more than a single point of glycosylation or other post-translational modification(s) in some paired comparisons and/or heterogeneity in glycosylation in others. Comparison of the major component of each mammalian virus (HBsAg p24, GSHsAg p22, or WHsAg p22), or the major polypeptide of DHBsAg (p18.5), with their respective larger polypeptides by peptide mapping indicated that one or more of the larger components in each virus shares extensive homology with the appropriate major component. Further, these larger components possess additional spots, interpreted as additional primary sequences, which were not found in the map of the appropriate major component. Collectively, the results suggest that a number of surface antigen-associated polypeptides may be partially encoded for by the pre-S gene region known to exist in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), and likely to exist in ground squirrel hepatitis virus (GSHV) and duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) DNA.",1983

All recombinant mRNAs contain intact SV40 early sequences that have normal splice patterns and produce wild-type T antigens.

In this study, we have assessed the priming capacity of highly attenuated poxvirus vector (NYVAC and ALVAC)-based HIV-2 recombinants, as well as Salmonella typhimurium HIV-2 recombinants in rhesus macaques. ALVAC- and NYVAC-based vaccine candidates expressing the HIV-2 gag, pol, and env genes or NYVAC-based recombinants expressing either gp160 or gp120 were used to immunize rhesus macaques in combination protocols with alum-adjuvanted HIV-2 rgp160. Following intravenous challenge exposure with 100 infectious doses of the HIV-2SBL6669 parental virus genotype mixture, seven of eight animals were protected from infection. The seven protected animals were rechallenged 6 months postprimary challenge, without additional booster inoculations, with the same dose of the HIV-2SBL6669 parental virus. Five of the seven animals remained protected against HIV-2 infection at 6 months following the second challenge. In contrast, oral immunization with recombinant Salmonella expressing the HIV-2 gag and the gp120 portion of the envelope either alone or in combination with alum-adjuvanted rgp160 failed to confer protection. These results suggest that the NYVAC- and ALVAC-based recombinants may confer long-lasting protection and that these two highly attenuated poxvirus vaccine vectors may represent promising candidates for developing an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome vaccine.",1995

Using an infectious cDNA of FMDV, we have constructed serotype A viruses in which the G-H loop has been substituted with the homologous sequences from serotype O or C. These chimeric viruses replicated to high titer and displayed plaque morphologies similar to those of wild-type viruses, demonstrating that the functions provided by the loop can be readily exchanged between serotypes. Monoclonal antibody analyses showed that epitopes contained within the loop were transferred to the chimeras and that epitopes encoded by the type A backbone were maintained. Chemically inactivated vaccines prepared from chimeric viruses induced antibodies in guinea pigs that neutralized both type A and either type O or type C viruses. Swine inoculated with the A/C chimera vaccine also produced cross-reactive antibodies, were protected from challenge with the type A virus, and partially protected against challenge with type C.

We have used murine models of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to liver to investigate these immunologic mechanisms. Adoptive transfer experiments, as well as studies involving genetic knockout mice, confirmed the original hypothesis that cell-mediated immunity induced by E1-deleted adenovirus destroyed trans-gene-expressing hepatocytes and defined MHC class I-restricted CD8+ cytolytic lymphocytes as the primary immune effectors for hepatocyte destruction. Responses mediated by CD4+ cells per se were insufficient to mediate destruction of hepatocytes in vivo, despite the activation of virus-specific T helper cells of Th1 subsets.

Insertion of the Gly-Ala repeats downstream of the 416-424 epitope inhibited CTL recognition of a chimaeric EBNA4 protein. The results highlight a previously unknown mechanism of viral escape from CTL surveillance, and support the view that the resistance of cells expressing EBNA1 to rejection mediated by CTL is a critical requirement for EBV persistence and pathogenesis.",1995

At least two signals are required for the activation of naive T cells by antigen-bearing target cells: an antigen-specific signal, delivered through the T-cell receptor, and a costimulatory signal delivered through the T-cell surface molecule CD28 by its natural ligand B7-1. The immunological benefit of coexpression of B7 with target antigen has been demonstrated with the use of several retroviral systems to transfect antigen-bearing cells. Although engineering recombinant constructs with genes for two or more antigens can mediate the dual expression of those antigens, disadvantages of this approach include the time for construction of each desirable combination and the inability to control differential expression levels of each gene product. An alternative approach would utilize separate constructs that could be admixed appropriately before administration. In this report we describe the functional consequences of the admixture of recombinant vaccinia murine B7-1 (rV-B7) to recombinant vaccinia expressing the human carcinoembryonic antigen gene (rV-CEA). Coinfection of cells resulted in high levels of cell surface expression of both the CEA and B7 molecules. Immunization of mice with various ratios (1:3, 1:1, 3:1) of rV-CEA and rV-B7 demonstrated that an admixture of rV-CEA and rV-B7 at a 3:1 ratio resulted in the generation of optimal CEA-specific T-cell responses. Next, we examined the efficacy of this admixture on antitumor activity. Typically, injection of murine carcinoma cells expressing CEA leads to the death of the host. One immunization of C57BL/6 mice with rV-CEA:rV-B7 (3:1) resulted in no tumor establishment. In contrast, administration of rV-CEA or rV-B7 alone had little or no antitumor effects. These studies demonstrate the advantages of the use of recombinant vaccinia viruses to deliver B7 molecules in combination with a tumor-associated antigen. The availability of the rV-B7 single construct and the ability to alter the B7 ratio could also have potential utility when coinfecting rV-B7 with recombinant vaccinia viruses containing genes for infectious agents or other tumor-associated antigen genes.",1995

Over the past 15 years, advances in molecular biology have permitted in vitro and in vivo gene transfer into mammalian cells. Genetically engineered microorganisms are highly promising developments for gene therapy and the future of vaccines. Such vectors constitute genuine tools for high level expression of heterologous genes for both therapeutic and induced immunity applications. Several vector systems have emerged with different relative advantages and limits depending on the proposed application. Adenovirus (Ad) has gained our interest, and in this review we focus on its applicability as a vaccine vector. We describe its potentials, as well as some of the foreseen obstacles related essentially to its use in preventive medicine.",1995
"122","s125556","bacterial pyrogenic exotoxins as superantigens.","bacterial pyrogenic exotoxins as superantigens.. The recent discovery of the mode of interaction between a group of microbial proteins known as superantigens and the immune system has opened a wide area of investigation into the possible role of these molecules in human diseases. Superantigens produced by certain viruses and bacteria, including Mycoplasma species, are either secreted or membrane-bound proteins. A unique feature of these proteins is that they can interact simultaneously with distinct receptors on different types of cells, resulting in enhanced cell-cell interaction and triggering a series of biochemical reactions that can lead to excessive cell proliferation and the release of inflammatory cytokines. However, although superantigens share many features, they can have very different biological effects that are potentiated by host genetic and environmental factors. This review focuses on a group of secreted pyrogenic toxins that belong to the superantigen family and highlights some of their structural-functional features and their roles in diseases such as toxic shock and autoimmunity. Deciphering the biological activities of the various superantigens and understanding their role in the pathogenesis of microbial infections and their sequelae will enable us to devise means by which we can intervene with their activity and/or manipulate them to our advantage.",1995

The need to control animal populations arises in many situations in the world from a variety of motives. Present control strategies are almost universally based on lethal procedures. Increasingly, there is dissatisfaction with such approaches from many different perspectives. In response to these concerns, the concept of controlling populations of pest species through control of their fertility has been mooted. Successful examples of this approach exist in cases of small, discrete pest populations but application of this to a widely distributed species over a broad geographical area has not yet been achieved. In this article, we report on a new approach to fertility control, virus-vectored immunocontraception, and discuss its applicability to control of wild rabbit populations. Particular emphasis is placed on the strategy for selection of a target molecule capable of inducing an immunocontraceptive response and on how the gene encoding such a molecule might be engineered into the myxoma virus for distribution into the population. The fact that the procedures for antigen identification and the viral engineering methods used are, to varying extents, generic means that the broad principles of this approach are applicable in other species.",1994

This study investigated whether a single amino acid change in the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule influenced the efficacy of formalin-inactivated influenza A (H3N1) vaccine candidates derived from high-growth reassortants between the standard donor of high-yield genes (A/PR/8/34 [H1N1]) and host cell variants generated from the same clinical isolate (A/Memphis/7/90 [H3N2]) by passage in embryonated chicken eggs. Two clones of the isolate generated by growth in eggs differed from the parent virus (represented by an MDCK cell-grown counterpart) solely by the presence of Lys (instead of Glu) at position 156 or Ile (instead of Ser) at position 186 in the HA1 subunit. The protective efficacy of egg-grown HA Lys-156 and HA Ile-186 reassortant variants was compared with that of the MDCK cell-grown reassortant vaccine. Classically, antibody titers in serum have been used to demonstrate vaccine efficacy. Here, parameters of B-cell responsiveness were monitored, including the kinetics, character, and localization of the primary antibody-forming cell (AFC) response and the development of B-cell memory in lymphoid tissues associated with the priming site (spleen) and responsive to pulmonary challenge with infectious virus (upper and lower respiratory tract lymph nodes). We show that the egg-grown HA Lys-156 variant induced an AFC profile vastly different from that elicited by the other two reassortant vaccines. The vaccine was poorly immunogenic; it induced antibodies that were cross-reactive prior to challenge but which, postchallenge with a lethal dose of the MDCK cell-grown reassortant virus, were targeted primarily to the HA Lys-156 variant, were of the immunoglobulin M isotype, were nonprotective, and were derived from the spleen. In contrast, the egg-grown HA Ile-186 variant was remarkably like the MDCK cell-grown virus in that protective immunoglobulin G antibodies were unaffected by the Ile-186 substitution but poorly recognized HA with Lys-156. Furthermore, memory AFC responsiveness was localized to regional lymphoid tissue in the upper respiratory tract, where challenge HA was found. Thus, it is recommended that in the selection of vaccine candidates, virus populations with the egg-adapted HA Lys-156 substitution be eliminated and that, instead, egg-grown isolates which minimally contain Ile-186 be used as logical alternatives to MDCK cell-grown viruses.",1995

Recombinant polioviruses expressing antigens from rotavirus, herpes simplex virus type 2, and hepatitis B virus were generated. Fusion of the heterologous polypeptides to the amino terminus of the poliovirus polyprotein did not prevent myristylation of VP0, suggesting a novel mechanism of myristylation for these recombinant viruses. The effects of the parental genetic background, different foreign sequences, and different insert sizes on growth characteristics were compared. Both the size and the nature of the heterologous sequence appeared to be factors influencing the growth and stability of recombinant polioviruses. All of the recombinants showed a temperature-sensitive phenotype, regardless of the genetic background (attenuated or wild type) from which they were derived. Preliminary studies with transgenic mice carrying the poliovirus receptor gene are discussed.",1995
"126","s128453","construction of intertypic chimeric dengue viruses exhibiting type 3 antigenicity and neurovirulence for mice.","construction of intertypic chimeric dengue viruses exhibiting type 3 antigenicity and neurovirulence for mice.. There are four dengue virus serotypes (DEN1 to -4), each of which causes major epidemics in tropical or subtropical areas. The current strategy for dengue virus immunization favors the use of a tetravalent vaccine preparation. We have previously employed full-length DEN4 cDNA to construct a viable intertypic dengue virus type 1 or type 2 chimera that contained the C-PreM-E or only the PreM-E genes of DEN1 or DEN2 substituting for the corresponding genes of DEN4. This success implied that it might be possible to create mutants of all four dengue virus serotypes for evaluation as candidate vaccines. In this study, we constructed DEN3-DEN4 chimeras that contained DEN3 C-PreM-E genes and expressed DEN3 antigenic specificity. Unlike our previous successes in cloning DEN1 or DEN2 chimeric cDNA, we were not able to clone the DEN3 C-PreM-E genes directly in the 5' intermediate vector or in the full-length chimeric DEN3-DEN4 plasmid in Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, a full-length DNA template of DEN3-DEN4 that could be used for transcription of infections RNAs was prepared by in vitro ligation. Progeny virus recovered from RNA-transfected C6/36 mosquito cells exhibited DEN3 antigenic specificity as determined by a reaction with monoclonal antibodies. Gel electrophoresis of virus-infected cell lysates yielded the predicted viral protein pattern, i.e., DEN3 C, PreM, and E and DEN4 nonstructural proteins. Two amino acid substitutions, Thr-435-->Leu and Glu-406-->Lys, which are analogous to mutations that, respectively, confer mouse neurovirulence on DEN4 and DEN2, were introduced into DEN3 E. A mutant chimera containing the Thr-435-->Leu substitution, which ablates the potential glycosylation site sequence, produced an E protein identical in size to that of wild-type DEN3 E, indicating that the glycosylation site is normally not used. Intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice revealed that the mutant chimera containing the Glu-406-->Lys substitution was neurovirulent, whereas its wild-type counterpart or parent DEN3 was not.",1995
"127","s129650","upregulation of class i major histocompatibility complex antigens by interferon gamma is necessary for t-cell-mediated elimination of recombinant adenovirus-infected hepatocytes in vivo.","upregulation of class i major histocompatibility complex antigens by interferon gamma is necessary for t-cell-mediated elimination of recombinant adenovirus-infected hepatocytes in vivo.. Recombinant adenoviruses are attractive vehicles for liver-directed gene therapy because of the high efficiency with which they transfer genes to hepatocytes in vivo. First generation recombinant adenoviruses deleted of E1 sequences also express recombinant and early and late viral genes, which lead to development of destructive cellular immune responses. Previous studies indicated that class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a major role in eliminating virus-infected cells. The present studies utilize mouse models to evaluate the role of T-helper cells in the primary response to adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to the liver. In vivo ablation of CD4+ cells or interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) was sufficient to prevent the elimination of adenovirus-transduced hepatocytes, despite the induction of a measurable CTL response. Mobilization of an effective TH1 response as measured by in vitro proliferation assays was associated with substantial upregulation of MHC class I expression, an effect that was prevented in IFN-gamma-deficient animals. These results suggest that elimination of virus-infected hepatocytes in a primary exposure to recombinant adenovirus requires both induction of antigen-specific CTLs as well as sensitization of the target cell by TH1-mediated activation of MHC class I expression.",1995

We have previously described a strategy for the recovery of a synthetic influenza A virus wild-type (wt) PB2 gene (derived from influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 [AA] virus) into an infectious virus. It was possible to introduce an attenuating temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation at amino acid residue 265 of the AA wt PB2 gene and to rescue this mutant gene into infectious virus. Application of this new technology to influenza A virus vaccine development requires that multiple attenuating mutations be introduced to achieve a satisfactorily attenuated virus that retains the attenuation (att) phenotype following replication in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate that putative ts mutations at amino acids 112, 556, and 658 each indeed specify the ts and att phenotypes. Each of these mutations was introduced into a cDNA copy of the AA mutant mt265 PB2 gene to produce three double-mutant PB2 genes, each of which was rescued into an infectious virus. In general, the double-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses were more ts and attenuated in the lower respiratory tracts of hamsters than the single-mutant transfectant viruses, and the ts phenotype of two of three double-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses was stable even after prolonged replication in the upper respiratory tracts of immunocompromised mice. Two triple-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses with three predicted amino acid substitutions resulting from five nucleotide substitutions in the cDNA were then generated. The triple-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses were more ts and more attenuated than the double-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses. These results indicate that sequential introduction of additional ts mutations into the PB2 gene can yield mutants that exhibit a stepwise increase in temperature sensitivity and attenuation compared with the preceding mutant(s) in the series. Furthermore, the level of temperature sensitivity of the transfectant viruses correlated significantly with the level of attenuation of these viruses in hamsters. Although the triple-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses were attenuated in hamsters, intranasal administration of these viruses elicited a vigorous serum hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody response, and this was associated with resistance of the lower respiratory tract to subsequent wt virus challenge. These observations suggest the feasibility of using PB2 reverse genetics to generate a live influenza A virus vaccine donor strain that contains three attenuating mutations in one gene. It is predicted that reassortant viruses derived from such a donor virus would have the properties of attenuation, genetic stability, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy against challenge with wt virus.",1995

Application of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to detect small round-structured viruses (SRSVs) from fecal specimens of patients with gastroenteritis has been insensitive because of the tremendous sequence heterogeneity between strains. We have designed two RT-PCR primer sets (G-1 and G-2) based on the nucleotide sequence diversity in the RNA polymerase gene of SRSVs belonging to two distinct genogroups represented by Norwalk virus (primers G-1) and Snow Mountain agent (primers G-2). All 22 SRSV strains examined that had been classified previously by solid-phase immune electron microscopy into four antigenic types (UK1, UK2, UK3, and UK4) could be detected by RT-PCR with these two primer sets. The G-1 primer set detected 6 UK2 strains, and the G-2 primers detected 16 strains, including 7 UK1, 5 UK3, and 4 UK4 strains. On the basis of nucleotide sequences of 81-bp fragments of the RT-PCR products from 13 strains determined in this study, together with those previously reported for 17 SRSV strains, we designed four sets of internal oligonucleotide probes (P1-A, P1-B, P2-A, and P2-B) for Southern hybridization, using chemiluminescent detection. The P1-A probe hybridized with PCR products from the UK2 strains; the P1-B probe, with products from two of the seven UK1 strains; the P2-A probe, with four of the remaining five UK1 strains; and the P2-B probe, with products from both UK3 and UK4 strains, as well as with one strain originally typed as UK1 which showed cross-reactivity with UK4 upon retesting by solid-phase immune electron microscopy. RT-PCR with both the G-1 and the G-2 primer sets can increase the detection rate of the many antigenically distinct SRSVs and, when combined with Southern hybridization, may predict the antigenic type of the SRSV associated with infection.",1995

CD8+ T lymphocytes (TCD8+) play an important role in cellular immune responses. TCD8+ recognize MHC class I molecules complexed to peptides of 8 to 10 residues derived largely from cytosolic proteins. Proteins are generally thought to be fragmented in the cytoplasm and delivered to nascent class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a peptide transporter encoded by the MHC. To explore the extent to which TCD8+ induction in vivo is limited by proteolysis or peptide transport into the ER, mice were immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses containing mini-genes encoding antigenic peptides (bypassing the need for proteolysis), or these peptides with a NH2-terminal ER insertion sequence (bypassing the requirements for both proteolysis and transport). Additionally, mice were immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding rapidly degraded fragments of proteins. We report that limitations in induction of TCD8+ responses vary among Ags: for some, full length proteins are as immunogenic as other forms tested; for others, maximal responses are induced by peptides or by peptides targeted to the ER. Most importantly, in every circumstance examined, targeting peptides to the ER never diminished, and in some cases greatly enhanced, the TCD8+ immune response and provide an important alternative strategy in the design of live viral or naked DNA vaccines for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.",1995
